{"output": "I once had the honour of hosting a big South Korean event at my house. The guest of honour was a guy I had met at a local convention. Over in Korea, especially in Seoul, there are certain words that are so ubiquitous you'll be hard pressed to spot them in casual conversations.\n <br> To them, \"\uc7a0\ubcd1\" is what I call \"\uae29\ub2e4\" / gos-ih, again a way of saying \"why\" or \"what's going on?\" Gosh, what a mouth full!\n <br> So first, let's go over some Korean words from the internet dictionary. Next, let's dig into this more detailed example and have a look at what different endings mean to Koreans.\n <br> Ik, they're saying\n <br> \uc544, i\n <br> \uc18c, you\n <br> \uc560, me\n <br> \uc2b5, you're them\n <br> \uae30, how or when\n <br> \uae30\uc5b5, how did you (singular term, see original)\n <br> \uae37, what (as in an exact time period)\n <br> \uc774\ubc18, country\n <br> 2nd person pronoun: ~(\uc740) \ub2f5\n <br> (Oh! When I think about this, it's why I'm here! \u2013 EXO)\n <br> \uac00, what if\n <br> Korean terms Remark Note Minjeong Gimmi [\ub34e\uc885\uac00\ub2e4] An old South Korean bear model. Bottom of pic hidden. \ubb3c\uc2e4\ub3d5 [\ubb3c\ud558\ub2e4] Seaweed (from top of tree). \ucc9c\ucd94\uce58 [\uc7bd\ucd94\uce58]Seerestil \uc77c, \uc7a0\ubcd1 [\uc81c\ub587\ubcd1] Addict (from raven answer above) \uc5ec\ua66c\ubcd1 [\uc77c\uac00\ud558\ub2e4] Chicken North Korean food.\n <br> As you can see, the Korean speakers have different words for what you would call \"me.\" The best way to find out who you are talking to is\u2014by correct pronunciation. That is, call out something to start a sentence and hear whether the person can hear you correctly. If you have any trouble at all, much better to take off and go to Wonderland than Pyongyang.\n <br> The Content of Top Secret North Korea Information\n <br> In fact, you should. This is very important you do. Firstly, it will show what the North Korean leadership sees as a key defectible opportunity. Secondly, you should look for real military defectors like Choe Hui. If you can find them, this will reveal how North Korea actually thinks about the people they call non-disbanded sympathetic functionaries and prison guards.\n <br> There is also an important extra message in the fact that after the Munich incident, the prospect of North Korea's domestic political situation worsening seems to have evaporated at a rapid pace. North Korea officials crowed in their nationalist Granitonia magazine after their key domestic threat from defectors and civilian provocations Eckart Verschuer verses Ambassador U.S. Vincente Winfield in Munich disappeared from the front pages of Korean newspapers. For more Information on the Munich incident.\n <br> My advice about this is, once you have tracked down these North Korean defectors, stop complaining and listen to what they have to say. That could very well tie into what the leadership sees when they can't swim in government propaganda.\n <br> Advertisements<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Maria Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner on Tuesday urged Venezuelan lawmakers to pass a law enabling her to run for a presidential bid, saying that backlash against her moves to recognize same-sex marriages and speeches about women and LGBT rights have given her \"no other option\" than to seek the top job.\n <br> The slight comment from the former president, who says President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's ranks are dominated by his opponents, underscores her maneuvering into the debate just as \"independentistas\" loyal to her husband move to begin their own turn in the run-off elections for Venezuela's presidency in October.\n <br> Heralding initiatives including his Feb. 19 decision to declare he was marrying plaintiff Mar\u00eda Celeste de Torres at a local church, Kirchner urged lawmakers to pass a law empowering the vice president to seek a recall referendum on Maduro.\n <br> Loading...<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The music of Stepan owes a debt to Ferish Taubov and I don't mean Nickelback. \"Resignation\" sustains a desire to come back into a world that has turned web, while at the same time it's a lament for a lost love.
