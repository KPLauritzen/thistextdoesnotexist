Among the car was a passport belonging to driving instructor Ismail Luby.\n <br> Experts said Luby was suspected by police of leaking other people's taxi drivers' information on drivers through a conference online website, which has become notorious for its legality.\n <br> Amman police said 75 investigations were being opened over the suspected involvement of the group linked to the Paris attacks.\n <br> The international criminal investigation, known as \"Magnitsky case\", named Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor from the Russian auditor's office, who was working for US-based investment fund London Capital Group.\n <br> Russia subsequently annexed Crimea in 2014 and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe has branded the site's operations illegal.\n <br> Forced to close temporarily\n <br> Jordan's state Criminal Investigation Department confirmed the case, and said special vehicles and officials were killed when strong winds blew the car off the road.\n <br> The police spokeswoman said at least 20 members of the public as well as personnel of Jordan's police chief and army were trapped in the auto garage.\n <br> That a stolen vehicle was wrecked by nature's fury on the other side of the world illustrates just how deadly the severe climate is for motorists in simply going for a ride.\n <br> \"We cannot force these dealerships to remain open, nor do we have the mandate for any kind of enforcement mechanism,\" the Jordanian Retailers Association said.\n <br> Driving licences are already difficult to come by since most people aged over 50 do not have them and it is illegal to sell two expired ones.\n <br> Javier Elwes, from the Fair Dealership Coalition, told AFP: \"With this incident, people are going to have to think twice before going into auto dealerships.\"\n <br> Defenders of online sales point out that such cars don't pose the additional risk of supporting organised crime.\n <br> But the group has pointed out that in December 2015, an hijacked bus full of people bound for central Paris was driven away with its engine running as the assailants demanded the \"Auto Sales Law\" be implemented for 3 and 4 wheel drives.\n <br> \"It's a nightmare for all these salesmen,\" Jordan's conservative King Hussein told reporters in early 2015.\n <br> Reporting by Azzam Al Hamwi in Amman and Adnan Hamid contributed to this article<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Chocolate Poke Cake with Goat Cheese-Crusted Mornay Seasonings\n <br> This chocolate-pistachio poke cake makes a delicious centerpiece for your holiday table. I recommend serving it warm. If you do try it warm, I recommend pouring over the top if 4 ounces of hot chocolate before serving.\n <br> Kinda reminds oldie but goldie. The word \"gizzard\" doesn't appear in the title. Glac\u00e9 is other to the goat cheese. The bacon said goat, but was I the cow being eaten right away? This is a damn good birdie \u2014 nothing nutty about it.\n <br> The potato skins would make a great garnish.\n <br> It's therefore a solid match for any of my times of the year, aka summer or winter. It is the perfect dish to bake when you are amping up the temperature. Kinda like that point right around the middle of winter when the humidity is high and the temperatures can rise. Snow can thus be a factor with pudding. Brown sugar is not guaranteed. Bear and roast if you have the manifest. I don't.\n <br> This spread the next weekend with ingredients to go with me in that needle in my arm. Cutting into it as early as possible helped. The glaze is cookie crumbs and\n <br>"}
