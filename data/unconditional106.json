{"output": "\"At the moment, it's going really well,\" Musk said on Bloomberg TV.\n <br> Last March, Tesla lost its chief executive, in one of its highest-profile firings in years. Musk started the company four years ago as a solar-car startup and expanded into the road force in 2013 as it started selling luxury electric sedans.\n <br> Since Tesla is focused on developing its autonomous car technology, most of the Silicon Valley government relations machine's work has been focused on packaging that technology in the center console of the Model S and Model X sport utility vehicles.\n <br> Musk has not been able to answer directly when Tesla will bring its autopilot software to Model S models.\n <br> He has hinted uberpools will be coming next year. But trees and 1,000-lb. weight increases could complicate a decision about having regulators test the program.\n <br> That leaves the robots to Buschluss, founded by Scott Sirangelo, founder of video game company Electronic Arts. After attracting tongue-and-cheek investment, the private equity firm has added engineering team and manufactured and sold its first helicopter for special ops training, Reuters reported in December.\n <br> Buschluss is pushing 75 live-action demos per week around the United States, but will probably be able to make it happen more often.\n <br> \"The structure of the venture enables us to get our products fully developed in more than 40 countries before the release of our first generation product, a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle,\" said Sirangelo, who also joined Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos on Wolfblitzer's debrief.\n <br> \"Clearly, if we just concentrate on just the U.S. there and really help test the United States and the EU, everyone would be safe. Unless you have a safety requirement that you have to be tested outside of the U.S., it's easy to do technology transfer and help build a helicopter fleet worldwide.\"\n <br> In Germany, a regulation aimed at protecting migratory birds might pressure electric-car companies into building data centers in Germany\u2014something Musk denounced as unnecessary. Sirangelo said the model initially was to bring in small business that would build and maintain facilities.\n <br> Even the Chattanooga Times Free Press has said the tech could be taught to self-drive. \"Once ushers see how it works, they can begin entrusting it to their sundry valets and cleaning ladies,\" the telegraphs noted.\n <br> But a customer taking delivery of an electric motor would have no time to step out of his car.\n <br> Meanwhile, consumers stressed it would be a mistake to make autonomous vehicles more automated than normal.\n <br> \"I think the safest way is to have a digital person in the vehicle, just as we have caller ID on your phone,\" at the wheel, said Maddie Jamieson, a Vanderbilt University researcher.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Show your support for Halifax's best chefs with these affordable and unique Halifax groceries and essential treatments.\n <br> Besides all of our food and booze we also have a variety of specialty Therapies and Herbal Supplements.

He refrained from personal statements but assured all parties of a prompt probe into the extent and seriousness of the incident.Commenting on the two cases, Singh said not only have the central government constituted an all-party committee to probe the violence, but the State government has also constituted a committee of experts to ascertain whether the state government is accountable and whether any court would be able to effectively intervene in a case like that.Private security industry in the country is...<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Rockstar Games will accept neither half-arsed minor accusations nor seriously defamatory statements about Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned either way, Dan Houser, director of the game, said Wednesday, as he denounced gamers who take sides in a three-year-old controversy over the Japanese title.\n <br> The company, which is owned by Take Two Interactive, has said this week that it will be slapping unspecified monetary penalties on consumers who steam the offending installment regardless of whether or not they accept or reject the games' oh-so-hardly-educated relationship fluff in its marketing. (What would a game say if it pushed sex and violence in the name of financial development, or vice versa?)
