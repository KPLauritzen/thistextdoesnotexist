{"output": "MONDAY: D.C. had at least 43,000 under-3 or low-income kids living in those two-parent households.\n <br> TUESDAY: More than 40 percent of the District's kids were living with two dads or Mom. That added up to almost 73,000 kids, at least 14 percent of all U.S. kids living with two men.\n <br> WEDNESDAY: 19,000 kids in the U.S. live with a single mom. The largest percentage of single moms (2.2 percent) in any given week, although there's little difference between metro regions.\n <br> THURSDAY: 31 percent of U.S. kids lived with a single dad, compared with 18 percent in D.C. Younger teen moms, at least 39 percent of all teens, living with their fathers, but otherwise, comparable.\n <br> FRIDAY: On the whole, the percentage of children in two mom households grew from 17 percent in 1995 to about 30 percent in 2011. However, 44 percent of U.S. kids were growing up in a non-mother quarter. Only 20 percent of family-structure matters matters to kids' well being. In the District, families at the lower middle are more likely to have either a primary or secondary breadwinner and the number of kids living in single parent households grew from 28 percent in 1997 to 39 percent by 2010, about 54,000 children.\n <br> EDWARD SNELLING's real estate publisher signs off.

So the alleged gender police bullying of the 14-year old's age crowd just really left me numb.\n <br> <br> The first time I saw Mahouka was when I was a kid. That was 1994, and it was hard not to get transfixed by its unique styling. And even now I have to keep reminding myself that Shinobu Oshino is our heroine, but as a 13 year old girl, that means more.\n <br> <br> Wonder what Sayaka Miki looks like?\n <br> <br> Look at these nails...\n <br> <br> Almost 16 younger people making a really powerful statement. This is Nanaha.\n <br> And...\n <br> <br> Alice, Yokunan Matume, and Sayaka Matume, one of them is even more beautiful.\n <br> Mahouka is a beautiful, unique, IMPORTANT, header anime defined by its completely queer, lesbian and gender fluid content. And yet those who hail it as a turn in the direction of something \"more mature\" make the same argument themselves and say it completely ruins the show. Note that I'm not talking about people saying it \"isn't allowed\" to be queer, mean, or even happy about it. I'm talking about people saying that this show is nothing more than a dressing up contest to attract more and more teen girls, with the main character's attention bypassing every other person who isn't caught in the rainbow.\n <br> <br> It's just so inappropriately grating, really, because its stated messages about morals and family really have nothing to do with the case of Akane. Takigawa's entirely justified anger is revealed to be the frustration of having to watch her childhood friend get treated badly under false pretenses. While Akane is shown to believe in not standing alone, that the world will look out for you and find you a place, she is shown to hold herself back as she tries to run away from her past and her parents. That isn't exactly as taboo a decision as trying to run away from her bullies, so why does she have to come out to everyone? Why it feels perfectly fine, justifiable, and acceptable to Akane, to waste everyone's time throughout the series? Why do I find myself pining and rooting for Akane's eventual happiness? Why can't I relate? Is it exactly enough to draw 14 year olds to it like the fans?\n <br> <br> And lest I forget, Mahouka ends with the TV ratings going up again. Eeehrrghh...\n <br> <br> Let me be clear: Mahouka is a sympathetic, getting-over-your-high-school-sex-scandal \"hide and shag manga\". In addition to being downright hilarious, it's a very selfless anime that gives the audience their money's worth by showing us why it's so important to embrace the clich\u00e9 and us those of us who might not appreciate it for the entertainment it lends us. The problems\u2014like some of its critics predict \u2014 aren't only with the simplicity of this message, but the fact that the story plays no different with younger or different viewers, no matter the gender they identify with. But there was a very specific audience that was most affected by Mahouka: the LGBTQI youth, particularly in North America's queer communities. These were the kids that I knew who one day would have to deal with embracing\n <br>"}
