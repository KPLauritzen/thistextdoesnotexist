Galactic clusters of stars form naturally within the Milky Way galaxy, and the tight grouping can now be captured through a NASA spacecraft JWST that is set to be launched in 2019.\n <br> Erick Clearwater, a graduate student of the University of Maryland, explains,\n <br> \"NASA's new Hubble Space Telescope promises to reveal even larger clusters in the very distant past than previously thought possible. By understanding how those massive clusters initially formed, astronomers can then understand how these distinct formations\u2014known as \"zombie galaxies\"\u2014have given rise to massive stars with their equally distinctive morphology and colors. Hubble will also help us understand the extinction events, violent collisions, that scar and splinter the cosmos, helping us understand the complicated behind-the-scenes process that produces life.\"\n <br> Erick Clearwater and his colleagues have reported their findings in The Astrophysical Journal.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>I worked with WinSxS for several years. It had been there for me whether I liked it or not. I was always taken back to the computers when looking for issues. It takes a bit of getting used to the UI, but it was enjoyable. Maybe what makes it part of the SIL Gets Ya \"gold\" hat band is that I pretty much keep it at the hip and forget it is there. As of 2007, as it makes a better user experience on Windows 7, I didn't write about it. But I did successfully conquer the thumb drive.\n <br> Today I came across this post and decided to write about it. It seems that we had all been living in water inhabited by some (perhaps many) unknown and singular menacing alien race.
