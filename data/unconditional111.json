In this post, I wanted to give you an explanation of how the learning results from the website that I've been watching for a while.\n <br> Here are the numbers for Unity Dev Kitchen. These numbers are from the xtent: 150 posts with 25K builds. The big picture idea here is that the \"games that work in one day\" result has been skewed a bit by the big spike after Unity 5 when all the low-income devs were rushing to get back in the game.\n <br> During this week, Unity 5 delivered 11.3M downloads all up. For those 622M monthly visitors, Unity 5 accounted for 0.0039% of monthly traffic. That's a lot smaller than the 0.0048% in June 2013, and a lot smaller than the 0.01% last month.\n <br> Then there's the \"games that works in one month\" results. Again, I'll wait for them to post the results for August (the upcoming release month).\n <br> February was November for the full month. October of last year was April.\n <br> Time to take a download\n <br> Everybody walks around with their little sand-sanboxing tool that splits your speck of an scene into chrome and other windows \u2013 Things like that. Or their CAD machine that creates a 51/49 color separation in 2 axes with some coffee can and Dymo mesh, etc..\n <br> Then, you make a call to get a ghost model, lots of resources, etc. etc.\n <br> Master Ninja \u2013 Jonny Scharf\n <br> Unity's Unity Master Ninja, Jonny, is teaching people how to demonstrate some very complex scenes in Unity. He does a good job of explaining things like using 1 VP in your scene or 2 of each object for camera perspective and how to work correctly with blur/bloom (great tip).\n <br> To take part in this one-day workshop, you'll need a Unity Runtastic account. I'd recommend this one given the sharing link above. You learn a lot and it'll be my challenge to run the 8-hour immersive workshop for real this very summer. In the end, that's what really matters at Unity \u2013 being able to do amazing things on a daily basis. The community really thrives on you succeeding in this way. So, let's sign up!\n <br> Dave Betz\n <br> A quick catch with Unity's CEO Dave Betz: he frequently makes videos on the Unity Connect channel about the Unity Coaching program through the Community forum. Here's some of the wisdom he shared with them:\n <br> Use a stage light instead of a gizmo and spatial placement of props\n <br> Show and don't tell. Assume your audience knows very little about your scene.\n <br> Good descriptions work better a hundred times over than long stories. Make people understand your scene with movies and pictures and not in words.\n <br> Learn from the next person who is building a complicated scene\n <br> Story development is almost always a mature skill if anyone is serious about it\n <br> Busy any Rich Attitudes Or Dreams And Goals Event?\n <br> That's impressive. Fun stuff from that keynote as well as from his 360 course:\n <br> Big accelerators like Oculus and Google Cardboard helped grow this VR infrastructure.\n <br> And, of course, everything about Unity\n <br> Share this on Visual Studio\n <br> Alright, now I'm almost as excited as you are to go and play with the information on the website I've been following for a couple weeks now. Not only do you get down to see how Unity fits into the overall ecosystem of development, but you also get 1) maps which were\n <br>"}
