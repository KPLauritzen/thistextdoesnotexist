{"output": "A four-year-old Sikh boy, who was sworn in to the UK's Royal Sikh Regiment (RSR) last week, was forced to apologise to his American-born school friend for inadvertently comparing him to a dog on Facebook.\n <br> Members of the Division 1 Sikh Regiment (DSS) will be less than impressed when the three-year-old reveals what he meant, given his experience of both the US and US pluralities.\n <br> According to the Regiment's website, \"two or more Sikhs Serving under the same flag is an honour of a totally private nature. It belongs only to them\". Its member oath, also written in Nepali, says: \"It is my duty, complete and wholly, to honour and obey my sergeant. And I take all simple commands courteously, even those which upset junior sergeants because I am the first to take an oath and to follow my order without straining the arm or stirring up dissension in unit, and directed only by the Sergeant or his assistants, commanders or major group leaders.\"\n <br> The RSR website states that no religious or political limitations apply to its members.\n <br> When 21-year-old Andrew Dalroy, a Colorado-born Sikh American living in London, first met the Sieh Wallinder at school, he noted about the fourth-grader that he was \"usually very quiet and rarely spoke as a normal adult would\". That changed when the boy loaned him his book, about dragons, and asked about one: \"Sikhs are a dragon kind of people?\" And we really are. I used to be Gshalens, but i changed my name]. Kids in the US tend to give names to other kids [in real life]. Anyone can call anyone else by the name in the US, but in real life it's very unclear,\" Dalroy said.\n <br> Indeed, Sikhism got an up and down start in the US but modernised in the mid-20th century. Today, 29 million Sikhs live in India, Mauritius and Nepal and a total of 535,000 reside in the United States.\n <br> <br> Surely, 'dragon people' (\"Gshi) are not allowed to be called by any name but the one they were given? And Andrew wrote a letter to tell the school that without correcting the harm caused, he already considered Wallister a rapist. Ha! I wonder if this will have any effect at all \u2014 'thank you' to the school for covering up the problem?\n <br> Lipstick on a pig? (always a sign)\n <br> But did the boy mean to put Wallister's sex into a positive light? A little screen cap on the District school website showed Karen Wallinder wearing nothing but luscious lips and hair as she held out her best 'wife' smile. Hell, even he could recognise that.\n <br> Whether the decision to let Andrew feign English and swear at the Parsi soldier archetype of Wallister (He was appointed identifiedattva Parikh by his chosen Guru) went through the school's heads or not, Dalroy pointed out that its 'Special Occasion' event didn't include any New Age interests. Would he want to go to the school on patrol tomorrow, after its diversity education programme ended, knowing that Schoolmaster Sir, it's not permissible to insult humans whom you are supposed to protect? And 12 years old is a little far for his young hearing. What about the Internet?\n <br> Will a month long holiday help Wallister disenchant the American's enthusiasm for women in uniforms?\n <br> But we can't forget about the third-level teacher who told Dalroy- Wallister and Andrew did not divide right, without mentioning the army test. Is Jasmine Gupta, who has taught Hindi at sixth grade, parents, and homeschooled boys, likely to be asked to have English lessons with these children after June, after she signed off on Mr Dalroy's letter to the school?\n <br> So once again, Wallister Wallister needs to be investigated by the brass. Even for Sikh youngsters, it's never a good idea to make a seven-year-old boy admit that he is creating a new identity without really focusing on \"humanising\" the child and getting him comfortable with his own skin colour. And as for Andrew Dalroy, he has said that as a IHRA beginner he must be totally open in answering every question children ask without hiding his feelings.\n <br> Parenting is all about adapting the upbringing prerequisites with the child's growth stage and needs. And in this case, Dalroy had a learning curve ahead of him, and a smart teacher.\n <br> What is the most special about this case, apart from the deep sense of injustice and outrage at the atrocities committed by Muslim murderers against the Sikhs in the 1990s?\n <br> The answer is of course compassion.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>We first set to work in the north of Spain in 1802 and, in combination with the psychologists of recognizing and ethics, we\n <br>"}
