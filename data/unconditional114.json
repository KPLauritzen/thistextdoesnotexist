{"output": "A Wanted sign points to mug shot of murdered Pennsylvania man Jerome Eve.\n <br> Discussions concerning parts of Jesse Feliss eight-page suicide note have been ongoing for several months among the Insane Clown Posse faithful.\n <br> A lot of the conjecture concerning the note was shaped by the fact that Feliss had written that he did not want to be a part of the group anymore. The Clown Posse has much more of a personality of its own than Feliss did. Some of the questions and some of the theories that have been published are baffling.\n <br> One of the most frequently cited theories is that Feliss was stabbed numerous times. No Auto-Crossing records have been found to corroborate this theory, however.\n <br> According to the FBI, Jerome Eve was murdered on November 3rd, a Saturday. Eve and a friend had returned to their home in Fishers, Pennsylvania after forming a New Emporium in New Jersey. While Eve's friend was waiting for them to arrive, he was grabbed by two masked figures and placed inside a car. The masked men then used a vehicle to plow into Eve's friend.\n <br> From there, the two masked figures jumped in another car and fled. No witnesses saw them take off, but a band of twelve neighbors all went to the house in the dead of night in an effort to find the lunatics and get home together. They eventually found their friend outside on a dock. They then held Garden Whitners accountable for their death. The two masked men were of course never traced, so this theory is very popular with cartoon fans and the ability of a Chicago cop to be paired with an infamous band is quite a cult hero.\n <br> The insgar goo comedy band continues to serve Chris Butler and his merry band of wrestlers in illfate acts.\n <br> On Twitter, @Joeuirilana tweeted about this theory and someone responded saying \"Booty in the mirror and let out a sigh~\" When other people claimed that Feliss was looking for an apology from the insgar band, this commenter said, \"That doesn't work too well with a chassis.\"\n <br> Did Fel, aka Jose \"Janey\" Perry, A.K.A. Mob Wipeout and the technical wizard Christopher Bibbs, A.K.A. Equalizer, Vietnam 52 ... or, was he murdered by people he thought were his closest friends, legends from Western Pennsylvania who divided right up the middle because of music and fan interest?\n <br> Feliss did remember loads of periods in his life so it would be hard for a report to say that he committed suicide by anyone but suicide.\n <br> We have contacted Chris Bibbs (President/Poet/Model/Walk-On for the Insurgents), Justin Vitter (aka Ketch Boop) (Wraps/Along with Doder), whom many fans of the Insane Clown Posse have figured out to be Joey Deeez --A.K.A. Foot Funk -- and there is only silence from the whole crew.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Rep. Elijah Cummings (D., Md.) told Yahoo News he will be leading the investigation into a White House data operation that might have solicited leaks on social media, or been impacted by foreign hackers.\n <br> The Democratic congressman told Yahoo News, in the wake of The New York Times' report this weekend that President Trump asked FBI Director James Comey to let go of the investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, that he would lead an independent inquiry.\n <br> Cummings, who assumed his post in 2011, sponsored and lost a bid for re-election by a special election last fall, withdrew from House Democrats' consideration to run for Senate majority leader on Friday.\n <br> In a brief interview from his Capitol Hill office, Cummings said that while he no longer will run for re-election, those motivated to take him on will face stiff opposition from fellow Democrats. On Tuesday, another prominent Democrat, state Sen. James Brochin, indicated he, too, had no plans to run for leadership as a specious and unqualified attempt to \"rewrite history.\"\n <br> Drawing on his experience as chairman of a House Oversight Committee, Candde Confirms to President Trump's Top IT Adviser Huma Abedin Account by Leaving Email in Weiner's WIFE'S HANDHELD PHONE \u2014 Report\n <br> With no incumbent to mark the exit of Cummings and never intending to run, Brochin said he decided to throw his hat in the ring.\n <br> Asked if he was exposing himself politically with his announcement, Brochin replied, \"I don't expect the normal rules apply.\"\n <br> :: Team Trump Has Hacks and Russia Connection, Attorney General Sessions May Recuse Himself; Republican Reps Refuse to Recuse Themselves\n <br> Brodin told Yahoo News that he had no corroborating proof, and that critical details such as the use of his letterbox and that he had sent his mother an empty box were disputed.
