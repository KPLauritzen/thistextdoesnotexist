{"output": "That means the U.S. economy is now the most uncompetitive in the developed world and it is about to stay that way for at least the next few years with the latest projections showing Japan's economy, now the third largest, will overtake the U.S. in share in 2013.\n <br> The International Monetary Fund released its latest Global Outlook on Wednesday and painted a picture in which an unprecedented global attack on labor on wages was beginning to take its toll.\n <br> Released just as Labor Day seems to be here, the IMF urged an instantaneous push across contentious grips to reach the Columbus Day deadline just 15 months away.\n <br> According to Reuters, the IMF said most countries \"had effectively entered into a 'two-speed' economy\u2014a small number of large expectations presence way above average productivity and wage growth, and a much larger group (around 1.5 billion) with diminished or still low expectations.\"\n <br> For instance, it said about 40 percent of the world's consumption will come from prosperity on the backs of the poor over the next decade. But families will have to spend 21 percent of their income in the U.S. on things like health care, education or housing and on a host of other social costs that are rapidly depositing absolute economic strain, like transportation.\n <br> An item included in the IMF Report is central banking:\n <br> According to the Bank for International Settlements, central banks are a sector with 25 percent of total employment and earn 30 percent of total income in the global economy, often with much more severe effects on growth and tariff adjustment. It should be no surprise then that central banks have been in retreat in the U.S. and other major economies, and are closing the door on the consolidation of risk banks. We expect all four major Federal Reserve System banks to shrink dollar policy would undermine growth in the years ahead without drastic TINA effects such a porting of reserves from Europe and Japan to the U.S., where they should grow. InEurope, Miller notes that many economists believe that the new decline of currency exchange rate liberalization means that advanced economies are gradually moving toward more competitive exchange rates\u2026 That is, potential growth in China is clearly underserved by its way of setting the Chinese currency upwards to a level at which it turns down the competitive power of currencies like the euro for exports. That is going to mean goes to mean that China is going to see additional moves toward moving into the competitive position of other key export countries, such as India and early next decade potentially other developing economies.\n <br> According to the IMF, the U.S. was not the only paid off nation in Europe on Wednesday.\n <br> Europe is to experience a gross decline in central banks nominal interest income of 13.6 percent from a year ago, while China actually expected to see this rise to 18.2 percent.\n <br> Not only that, but Italy and Spain both said the UK would dampen its economic comeback.\n <br> And just like the New York Fed, the IMF that anticipates the crisis is in a room full of risks, most significantly of a run on Greece and other countries, and those countries becoming forced out of the Euro:\n <br> This in turn could trigger a significant retaliation at sub-euro zone countries with large banks that could lead to a reinforcement of bets against embarking on further reduce had central banks decreased interest rates further down the road. This would prompt a further reversal among other central banks on the ECB's bond purchase program, and this leads to considerable adverse effects on the realization even if policies could find some way to complement the naturally distributed costs of credit creation or the desires of depressed consumer markets in typical developed economies of reporting National of Debt-free issuance.\n <br> Although those Will be as early as November of this year, this dire forecast will be as true in the U.S. as it is in Europe.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>A Democratic congresswoman surprised supporters Tuesday as she called for \"real leaders\" to address the crisis in Venezuela.\n <br> Speaking at New York University's speech on democracy, Rep.
