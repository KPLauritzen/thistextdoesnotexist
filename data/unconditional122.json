{"output": "Given it's first day of the new year, we here at the Edge have decided to break down all of the fifteen games and free content that have dropped in the past month. This will be a series here on the site with something happening every day leading up to December 31, 2013.\n <br> News\n <br> <br> Legendary Items \u2013 All Hallows Eve and Full Moon cycle players have claimed new ways to advance in multiplayer with two new seasonal Legendary items to add depth to their characters.\n <br> Party Mobs \u2013 Players can now summon members of their party regardless of their current host using the line \"ooc soul once\", this combination allows for a host that may not be suitable for solo play. However, they are able to participate in the opposition and at least one box will pickup the player making option.\n <br> <br> New Art \u2013 These new Legendary canons will change the tone and textures of the game in terms of how players look with the additions of new eye customizations or change as to what their wearing. Some are more dramatic while others are like a generic uniform.\n <br> Over-Crafted and 2 Slot Quest Spots \u2013 In the returning content of Year 0, the unused GM slot 1 has transformed into a 7 slot vendor. This will replace the old option of Blue from version 1.05, but it's not expected to even go live for beta 3. Players will have a further opportunity to reserve space on the new slot befitting of being serious quest givers with the Legendary\n <br> Daily Dungeons \u2013 In one of the more eclectic preview talks, C.A.N.T Solutions has been offering their cybertank and unique catching traps in Exchange Town daily dungeons. These are memorable and innovative in everything that they say from their use of players in non-combat divinations which have casted a destructive spell onto Argus. It turns down this summer, Offworlders will be placing a decent save at the FF8cd (Heros' actual DF can claim any spot in the world they wanted to after killing 30 level 20 enemy FFX IVs) which offers brand-new Delve dug into inside of Argos. Inside they discovered the alien hands of Flux, the same race forced in shame of future Final Fantasy X.\n <br> New Field Gags \u2013 They can be locked up in your town from CBT version. These are a bonus shed of dialog for the first Golden Flare, confirming messages will hire along side this event which run every day 7am-9pm PST.\n <br> Bind Skill Guides For Part 2 \u2013 From subject matter expert Dylady, a form of Major in this week is to try and teach the battle/job mechanic system of the FF9 Final Fantasy series, the Binding Blade, the process to create your own new skill builds. This must be made use of while the BSB search helps with slotting and material utilization ideas. It also establishes the norm for unlocking the overbooked Lao-Shan part of the growth chart.\n <br> Super Capital \u2013 In addition to a colossal Sun farm venture that offers purchase of Wheat, Potash and Neuroscience Roxas can negatively clue Garland instances ordered. If the lvl 52 Mythril encounters are being broke.\n <br> Periodic Cave \u2013 Cross the common river in Luna Caverns and West Falcon for a shrine containing an instant auto drop and let the graveyard gremlin go to work itself. The changes made are at the expense of the GD as it's base is far more open rather than the wind-yard, a massive layout.\n <br> Cheat Codes 2.0 \u2013 Alphastorm has gone to long to create the community party stash in Alexander Forest this week making it far more collaborative. Chirality has now added gamification to the cheat code collecting stream. With two new objectives you just have to complete and get your equipment from the functions/pages associated to that objective. The 'Absolutely Flare' objective trades oyster keys for Codcoins, Gems and\n <br> Medals that can be used on other achievements.\n <br> 3 New Characters \u2013 The devs have today also been unveiled their new. Since up until this week, they still had been under wraps, but they debut late in the IDs 214 classic times loads (probably Airship only), bringing in a variety of new characters from the various video games that are set for Beta 3, Expanded Range of Characters (Excluding The originals), and quite possibly Missing Chocolates' forthcoming mystery character. Below is a idea of fun things they may and may not teach,\n <br> Other Announcements/Actuals Twitch streams will be interesting, and we'll be sure to bring you more as they are available.\n <br> Who knows what we may learn in the coming months? It'll keep us up to date.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Since the Lumia 900, Microsoft has shipped several devices operating on a blend of Windows Phone 7.x and latest versions of Windows 8/Windows RT 8.1/Windows Phone 8 Key features and improvements at launch Lumia 800 Lumia 800 Dual SIM Lumia 800 Android One Lumia 710 Lumia 710 Rear\n <br>"}
