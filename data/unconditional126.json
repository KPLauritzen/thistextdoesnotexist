{"output": "Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby announced Monday that six police officers had been arrested for allegedly framing 18-year-old Freddie Gray for whole-cloth stealing a $5 from a police officer. The Baltimore Police Department called Mosby's announcement a \"cover-up.\" It sounds like it. The statement released by Mosby's office from today, where all the restraining order fraud was launched, sounded like 21 days of an earnestly hyped soft-pedaling of scandal for a victim that wasn't, in fact, guilty of stealing a slice from a civil servant's wallet.\n <br> ***UPDATE 4:17 PM: Baltimore police say from where they shot 24-year-old Freddie Gray\u2014not in the back and not when he was restrained by the police\u2014interviews from both officers could help lead to the men charged in the case being held accountable for their actions. \"There is evidence that another member of the Street Crime Unit chased and tackled and was approximately 17-24 feet from the deceased prior to police arrival,\" the BPD said they want evidence to support that statement. They are apparently looking at the video of officials urinating on a casket.\n <br> ***UPDATE Noon EST: At a press conference, Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said that the physical evidence on the scene of the fracas but that they were waiting on medical reports before making any reports or commenting on the report that Freddie Gray somehow injured himself while being transported to the hospital.\n <br> Yes. Nine or ten days ago, the Baltimore Police Department thought this insane version of events\u2014an overweight victim with blocky peanut butter-brown eyes flailing around on the floor and a madman peering out from an elevated walkway that one either unarrested officer originally excused\u2014would hold together a bumpy ride for them in meaningfully investigating the murder of a young man. One thing didn't hold together that hideous ragtag stack: bigger picture.\n <br> Cops told the New York Times they believe Gray performed CPR and was shouting for help in the hospital, despite all zero medical staff in the incorrect currency of seconds leading to his untimely death. Two medics rushed to The Citadel Hospital where he was admitted a mere five minutes later after it was hammered by riots and protests. He'd tell a nurse he was feeling better and was departing?\n <br> Once wounded, Gray's cuffed hands were moved to a garbage cart where they remained for fifteen minutes before being discarded in the garbage disposal. There were two individuals roaming in the area outside of the install who watched a suspicious person dispose of his dead body. Pictures of the double-helicopter sweep of the remains led to questioning of at least seven different bystanders who did not see the entire thing. Some of them played dumb and were\u2014in all likelihood\u2014convinced Batts and other top brass.\n <br> ***UPDATE 5:56PM EST: The Batts statement containing all this craziness:\n <br> Since this morning, the City of Baltimore and the City's police department have been working diligently and cooperatively to resolve the investigation into the death of Mr. Gray. The efforts so far have been gratifying, but they have not been sufficient to resolve satisfactorily the officers involved, nor have they made us whole. We have continued to be open and transparent throughout the entire process because we believe it is ultimately in the best interest of justice to ensure that the public has the full and accurate record of our actions and other elements of this tragic event.\n <br> And continuing, BPD officials are not covered by the restraining order fraud.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>While it's tempting to look upon Yahoo's last few years of failure as an inevitable product regression being dragged along by a greedy acquisitions department, and thus inevitable price hikes, look at it this way: Whatever Yahoo did turning over a new leaf back in 2012 \u2013 bringing the price of a realized $70+ billion company down below $25, trips Latin America for a drastic price reduction last November; and making a steady series of four acquisitions in the past 18 months \u2013 ended up with a new, higher priced operating profit margin in 2013, and a much needed trip into the black late last year.\n <br> Which means the acquisition merry-go-round will go on as usual for awhile, we just really need to work on not talking about it.\n <br> That might not happen though, as last night, during the company's earnings call, Yahoo Chairman Marc Andreessen had this to tell the company's \"new transformation adviser,\" former Google VP Richard Hayne:\n <br> \"The fundamental reason we're cautious for now, I think, is our rate of long-term capital spending remains very slow, so that's the thing that's motivated me.\"\n <br> Some will think it's impossible that Andreessen could be factored into a renewal of Google's overture, but consider this: There's a market for 1) Wearables and 2) Messaging Ideas and we're clearly in a dream role for engineer to construct killer, next-gen products that address both /Google\n <br>"}
