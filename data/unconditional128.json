{"output": "advertising\n <br> The soap opera finale for South Park may have ended with Cartman and his classmates gonna the school carnival to celebrate beating their stupid middle school enemies by evil minions. Soon after, it appears the show might take a more consequential turn this upcoming season.\n <br> According to new stage directions, 20/20's pending Season 21 will deal with economic anxieties in as soon as one week, presumably focusing on the devastating economic collapse currently spreading across a number of American cities. This announcement suggests that a possible Season 22, depeding on Cartoon Network demanding additional episodes rather than a breaking news announcement of the group's disbandment, may indeed \u2014 shocker \u2014 be burdened by issues more important than just cloning the last time they saw the school's vice-principal desperately trying to cover her eyes with a bag into the air of her vagina, then trying to leave the school to join her sawdust queen oligarch husband in an exotic vacation resort at the same time.\n <br> Current casting calls (now signed off by both the actors andComedy Central mandated re-writes) specify that a \"flashback\" episode 22 (perhaps titled \"Future Stockman\") will focus on Donald Trump, which may or may not catch up with the animators' initial plans to go back to 1986 and 1994. They finally settled on 1996 to coincide with the launch of Trump's 1996 venture, Trump Steaks.\n <br> By all accounts, the unscripted show that the producers have been crafting between episodes 13 and 23 has progressed (if only very academically!) since 2011 when it evolved from a set of four shorts into a complete episode. It's no secret that behind the scenes, longtime co-exec producers Alec Berg (106\u00b0 Farenheit Rudy's Pizza) and Matt Stone (Enters The Mind Of\u2026 The Amazing Race!) have been getting more and more involved in the series' episodic proceedings as well, as they adjust to a new proscenium show-running dynamic.\n <br> advertising\n <br> It couldn't come soon enough. During their highly-successful freshman run, the mini-series gamed parody of South Park kicked off massive popular gusts each time, believing itself able to rattle political correctness and foreign policy with crooked twin spinoffs of bankers in Zion and unemployable multi-millionaires covered in balloons. They proved so successful, that the Idea Factory even debuted a rumored series for HBO as a prequel to the series, but the time allotted for the pilot proved prohibitively high, ruining the potential payoff.\n <br> With only so much dirt to cover the subject matter of South Park, maybe it shouldn't be surprising that the creators are now re-evaluating the reboot for a more mature 20/20 series. The previous material drifted to Springfield, with every bit that was said in parody missing a useful connotation from reality. Considering current events around the world, the American demographics, the financial crisis, and various other social crises, a similar excursion to a relevant storyline is arriving sooner than expected.\n <br> advertising\n <br> South Park may not be the only media property on the block that will be shaped more by its agenda than its target demographic. Although it has already re-emerged on cable network Comedy Central following its Adult Swim cancellation, the only ongoing iterations of Seinfeld and Friends to deal with a dopey group of primary school kids are in need of balancing egos, demanding fans, and your regular viewing hours.\n <br> advertising\n <br> Still, a continuation of the medium's beloved magical educational meme could be far less hideous than many of the alternatives. Maybe those glassblowers, machinists, and think tank types will finally arrive at Springfield's endless test assembly line for 16 more episodes of nerdy watched terror. Considering their demon-possessed gifts, there might even be some unseen Edward Norton in the cast.\n <br> South Park will return to air on September 16th. The 2017/2018 season premieres on Comedy Central in the autumn of 2016.\n <br> Source: Juxtapoz\n <br> advertising\n <br> Give Screen Rant a Thumbs up!\n <br> Luke Cage's Mike Colter Comments On MCU Change Recasting\n <br> Share Tweet Email Copy Link Copied\n <br> advertising<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Miami School of Medicine and the Brown University School of Medicine is a Regional Anesthesia Program\n <br> Anesthesia is a state of biological anesthesia in which individuals have unconsciousness entirely for the purpose of anesthesia and anesthesia training.
