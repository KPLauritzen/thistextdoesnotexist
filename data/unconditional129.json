{"output": "Matt Jones gave the Sam Houston State University students just what they requested, yet still they had questions about the team. He explained that the quarterback relies on self-study to give a one-on-one impression while Smith taps out answers on paper and designs offensive and defensive plays.\n <br> Jones' newest development? He has a message for receivers as he remains adamant their responsibility is to catch the ball.\n <br> \"The receiver still has to make plays,\" Jones said. \"Personnel isn't the biggest thing. It's making plays of your own. More than anything, that means you support downfield or catch the ball. If we need and we want to punt, we will punt, but the player still has to catch the ball.\"\n <br> As an up and coming recruit for SMU, Jones would rather it weren't all about the football.\n <br> He spends his free time out on the swimming pool and beach while also taking part in his high school's local Track and Field team. He also attends night school during the week after his game for homework help. It's not an easy life, yet Jones has earned respect coming from the highest in SMU.\n <br> \"I think he's incredibly talented and has a lot to offer. He's intelligent, physically strong, great footwork. He has the same type of burst as Carson (Wright),\" SMU head coach Chad Morris joked after receiving attorneyales from the Waco native this spring.\n <br> Jones has his work cut out for him trying to turn Tennessee Head Ball Coach Jeremy Pruitt's maximization formula to some semblance of life on the field with the Vols.

Screenplay work by high school students Makoto Shinkai and Chiaki Konaka and animated by studio 4C began crafting 1964's original failure\n <br> into \"a blockbuster phenomenon,\" and will be presented exclusively domestically in the U.K. and Ireland from February 26-May 2, 2015. It is directed by Ryutaro Nishiura (Endride, Your Lie in April), with animation production handled by A-1 Pictures.\n <br> In \"Roar,\" Rito joins Ruka, Usagi, Luna and Makoto on an adventure into the depths of the world's oceans to save Sailor Uranus and Luna, who disappeared while attempting to bring submarines back to Earth. First Seen the Golden Future Cup tale \"Sailor Moon\" debuted in Japan in 1984 with Sailor Moon on Action in 1987. More recently hinted at return royal action with Team Finland in the latest movie.\n <br> Makoto Shinkai and Takeshi Obata also penned the original story, which Shinkai said he immediately loved, and is thrilled that the world it came from will be brought back for the first time in years.\n <br> Funimation will being dubbed the \"Roar\" theatrical run at theater near you.\n <br> SOURCE: ANN<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Hotell Delivery What do PhD students do for a living?
