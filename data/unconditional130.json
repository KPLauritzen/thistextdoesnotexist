{"output": "Intelligence experts have spotted Chinese ex Linux malware pouring into computers and PCs across the world, with countries like Russia, Georgia, Israel, India and Ukraine taking the brunt of the infections.\n <br> The malware is the newest and most advanced version of China's Stuxnet malware, which has affected Iran, Iraq and Syria, energy sector anochronous, the UK's foreign systems board, Saudi Arabia, a hard drive maker and several banks. It has been under development for over a year and a half, and was released some time in the last two weeks, among other infections.\n <br> The creator of the malware, codenamed \"Element115\", is believed to have invented the same type of malware used by the US and Israel in their covert cyber attack operation on Iran's nuclear program by code name \"Olympic Games\".\n <br> According to a WikiLeaks Vault 7 email - which noted that a French hacker nicknamed \"pwnsauce\" had written a report of what he called \"Great Russian Spying\" against Europe and the US - the malware is believed to have been part of the Snowden files obtained by the whistleblower.\n <br> Security experts who have analysed the new Chinese malware say that over 75% of the systems impacted by the malware have been Baidu Tech figures, and that six \"weaponized\" PCs are believed to be active.\n <br> \"We identified pieces both of the code that is stored inside the malware and of the associated architecture,\" Paul McGeough, an independent security academic, told Reuters.\n <br> \"What's quite unique about this is that it uses a unique architecture indeed, which is related in some way to Microsoft DLL injection or to dynamically generating executable code.\n <br> \"We do not know enough of the relevant pieces of the firmware and firmware-relevant libraries to claim it is new - it's an old development/revision of previous Linux CodeView malware.\n <br> \"We suspect the malware is the work of the Chinese government or a Chinese agency who has access to the Southern and Indian Cyber Armies. There's a certain amount of overlap between North and South and they could easily swap around, but we can't get a black-box perspective.\"\n <br> Several countries in the east, including Russia, find themselves notorious as the targets for such malware. It can be used by the Chinese US government to target countries around the world.\n <br> India comes in third, but low tech countries like Georgia are the culprits all else being equal. After Russia, advanced countries, like Germany, and, Asian computer factories, such as Taiwan and South Korea, grabbing second and third place respectively.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Player Comparison Finder: George Hill (2015-16) vs. Avery Bradley (2015-16) vs. Jeff Teague (2015-16)\n <br> Show/Hide Search Form Use the back button to change the form Make Tiny URL\n <br> Click on the red text to pre-fill the form with various values Compare Cumulative Seasons (e.g., compare Kobe Bryant through age 28 to Michael Jordan through age 28) Compare Single Seasons (e.g., compare Kobe Bryant at age 28 to Michael Jordan at age 28) Player 1 Javascript is required for the selection of a player.
