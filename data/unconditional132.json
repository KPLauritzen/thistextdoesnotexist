But Boulter, a longtime resident of Montgomery Village, said the houses are only occupied to give the owners a sense of neighborhood, and for the help of the artists. Pepon Belton of Music and an avowed \"of course it's a secret\" member members of Preservation Montgomery recently said while they haven't been in the house in several months that they expect the house to be renovated in the next few seasons.\n <br> Tomasello, Mount Vernon Park resident since 1980, said that most are becoming less active often. Nelson, who purchased one house in recent years, hasn't been there for a not too long time, he said.\n <br> But new faces have joined the group. Rosaniy will be serving as whatever the house is occupied by, Nelson said. Jacqueline Kreeger, University of Maryland graduate student, posted on a community page a few months ago that she's under the impression the house is a redundant house, and that she wants to \"go elsewhere forever.\"\n <br> Braas, another University of Maryland graduate student, said earlier this month that she has been there of many years and she hopes to contribute to the project that she has been told is a possible renovation.\n <br> \"They've been doing this long enough. Before, you walked by and said hi then, now it's basically a bunch of strangers,\" Braas said, gesturing for lighter cigarette smoke to drift at her. So like Braas a number of times throughout the course of the hod when a passing car rolled up to pass her on the street corner, or when she observed the group walking down the street sometimes, Braas was confused by the names the strangers of the house kept using in conversation. \"I keep calling them. Nobody answered. How do you know which one is who?\"\n <br> Braas on Wednesday also asked about the potentially sinister aspects of the event that can be a recurring feature of this kind of neighborhood meet-up. Kaliel Rice, who lives in the same home as Braas, communicated her desire to remove this particular hypothetical, which could vaguely pertain to the legalities, as soon as possible. \"I'm scared,\" she said apologetically.\n <br> Sitting each in a chair in the beautiful bedroom, including the smaller nook where Belton could always hop on another bed if he desired without being pushed against the chest of drawers, Nelson discussed the archives of the event. Three times a year since 2008, he explained that friends of members book their vacation plans to visit Unity with the intention of meeting up in the house that week.\n <br> The residents at the front of the house have met the monthly dates previously, five had visited the remainder, and few of the remaining have missed it. \"7 tracks, drums, ghost participants, head high unnerving squirrels -complete frustrating otherness notedis -highly addictive. Brilliant.\" Nelson said as he put down his martini. \"Chills.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>\"Human dignity claims were lost in this massacre, and hundreds of lives were lost, families devastated, and an already fragile community traumatized. As we gather together to mourn tomorrow's atrocities, it is also essential to go to this place itself \u2014 a place like these, where so much was discovered in previous excavations. And where this many bodies found today will find a respectful end. Once the dignity claim is joined, it can be condemned and admitted to the terms of the Unesco Convention.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>President Trump, first lady Melania Trump and their son, Barron, walk to Marine One at the White House on Thursday. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n <br> President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, told a friend recently that President Trump and his family are in constant touch and that the First Family's West Wing \"is a weekly wedge and presentations of Mediterranean traditions and Asia sleight-of-hand.\"\n <br> Kushner also told the friend that the First Family \"keeps in touch\" with events they care about that \"are important to them, which is why you see President Trump tweeting, yes, about Bana al-Abed and the Syrian refugee situation, and of course, the storms in the Southeast, but also their pilgrimage\n <br>"}
