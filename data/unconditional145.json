{"output": "Funimation has begun streaming a new original anime video for four individuals who helped refashion the world into the frightening, whimsical fantasia of Marle-chan , the story of the magical childhood friend of J\u014dichir\u014d Takamachi ( Mushishi , A, Hana , Philosophy, Ry\u014dko ); Aina Suzuki ( Sailor Moon Crystal , School-Live! ) is directing the anime at j.c.Staff , and Misaki Kuno ( Sailor Saturn - Galaxy Sister , Sword Art Online II , DVD-BOX , Knights of Sidonia ) is supervision. .\n <br> The four heroes \u2014 who have the names Miharu, Chloe, Yugo, and Rix \u2014 are in their late teens and live together in an abandoned city, fighting each other and taking care of Marle each day.\n <br> Ulimation is credited as narrator.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Sometimes the road to Pride is not paved.\n <br> Four notoriously bigoted individuals dressed as street vendors refused to leave a Toronto church \u2014 and were apprehended.\n <br> However, the act of painting the anti-gay mural \u2014 which read \"Pride is not a sidewalk\" \u2014 didn't end up doing them much good.\n <br> \"No objection admits the commission of a wilful act to damage, deface, intimidate, intimidate or interfere with the lawful use of property in any manner contrary to section 97 or the generally accepted interpretation or use of section 97,\" says an application described as a use-of-force notice recently submitted by Toronto police.\n <br> A staff sergeant spoke at a meeting before the mural was painted, writing in a document that \"proponents of the visual art and those in its queue have immersed themselves into a discourse which engages the flow.... By refusing to leave the Church.\"\n <br> Although not committed to completion of the artwork, the brazen permit permit authors were apparently determined to continue realizing their killer Bad Guy approved artwork. Fortunately, there was video surveillance, which would allow police to apprehend the homeless tent-sellers who refused to leave the Catholic sanctuary.\n <br> \"Given the exchanges between our six volunteer canvassers, and our police officers, it was clear that the reason the homeless were hurrying to remove the high-visibility paint was that they had no knowledge that the paneling was to be removed - they dismissed it from a Caucasian perspective,\" writes Christopher Lewis.\n <br> Police were assists \"by surveillance video that showed instances and instances where now [they] were standing in front of the panel and onlookers asked why the people painted there had installed railings and walked by,\" Rogers writes. Yet, in fact the homeless people \"remain steadfastly refused to comply to a request to actually leave.\"\n <br> Meanwhile, one pastor was also willing to facilitate the 'Rainbow Prayer Procession', chanting along with attendees, as well as offering Mel Toadstedt picnics.\n <br> The crackdown began, the pastor said, after some young men in pretzels strolled past with their megaphones wondering when the lawsuit false-flag was going to be flipped the other way.\n <br> While pasting anti-\"Pride in the name of Satan\" slogans on walls is nothing new, the brazen planning of Black Pride \u2014which was also scheduled to be blasted from the outside of Nuit Blanche \u2014 made many think the poorly thought out inflatable raft ride in Toronto's Gay Village was a straight-shooter.\n <br> But as Toronto police reminded us, however you celebrate, it's about love and acceptance.\n <br> Follow Mack Lamoureux on Twitter.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Oh the joys of packing his own lunch \u2013 especially a massive one made straight from his own back yard!\n <br> Jason, a Toronto resident, picked up and cooked whole pumpkins at his South Central Toronto abode. And one by one, he cradled and nursed them through the night.\n <br> The friends lovingly named their accomplishments Beta Beta Bang Bang.\n <br> \"We picked them up in fresh containers from the local produce stand\u2026 and prepared them all ourselves for a total cost of about $20 each,\" Jason explained on Facebook. \"There was a dead pumpkin in the kitchen sink, but I smell like normal dreams,\" he enviously laughed.\n <br> He created each entrails by filling vegetable oil to the brim then focused piercing it with a bright red drills bit. As the pumpkin was cooked for three hours, Jason crammed time in between bites to press the cannoli into its perfect shape.\n <br> \"Once they were in the pot, they had to sit in the boiling water for 30-40 minutes before we could drink them,\" Jason added.\n <br> After they were done, the kids hung the pumpkin \"entourage\" by Natalie's maroon ribbon (Yeah its what she got \ud83d\ude09 ). Next week is Halloween. OMG, I can't wait!\n <br> Happy Halloween!<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>During mid-afternoon diner hours on Tuesday, Stewartstown Power Administration crews were lining up again.\n <br> The Best Butcher Shop at 4796 The Interchange\n <br>"}
