{"output": "A man was injured in what appears to have been a random shooting in the Bella Vista-Glider Park area Saturday afternoon. He keeps habeas corpus, which he requested as his trial for allegedly attacking a fellow Richmond man.\n <br> After attending to the stabbing victim, a detective from Richmond police ran to the nursing home and talked with the man, a man bringing a knife to work on Friday.\n <br> They spoke for about 5 minutes.\n <br> Less than 5 minutes into their conversation it became apparent that his faith was not the focus of service to him.\n <br> One of the officers asked the man, \"How's this Jews Test\" he was quoted as saying.\n <br> \"Was this my answer?\"\n <br> \"Yeah, it's OK.\"\n <br> The cop also talked to the man about the state of the country and criticised President Trump for not investigating Russian interference in our voting system, saying, \"Open season on Trump supporters.\"\n <br> As about 11:40 P.M. the detective ran him off to jail to be held for 'his own safety.\n <br> The police department doesn't release officer-involved shooting info, didn't think the man would be harmed.

Harrison McClary/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n <br> NFL officials are scheduled to meet next week with Wilf and his children to discuss relocation possibilities, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and his two immediate predecessors declined the franchise's previous requests to relocate to Los Angeles.\n <br> If Minnesota heads into Los Angeles without a new stadium, all revenue from team merchandise would have to stop flowing to Wilf and his family after 2015. While the franchise cannot officially pursue relocation until 2016, the owners have had the chance to \"meet and confer\" with Wilf and his executives.\n <br> Problem is, the Vikings still have one more season at their current KeyArena home before they need to vacate or build a new venue. This plan from Lambeau Field's after the 2014 season would leave Minnesota Stadium (at the stadium site in a private development) out of the equation, and the Minnesota Vikings would have to leave the city too.\n <br> My source tells me @justinamarter didn't want this discussion:2x @Vikings are exploring the #NFL over L.A. ticket requests. #Vikings plan is to stay in Minneapolis. http://t.co/3T3vrRBVBe \u2014 David J.

Chao, WPLN-CSN (@DavidChao) November 18, 2014\n <br> <br> According to a source who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the NFL has been exploring a scenario that would grant Wilf a temporary exemption for years while the team explores other stadium options.\n <br> The source told me other team owners spoke with the owners of the Raiders and Chargers this month to try to rally support for any kind of temporary move. In addition to the Raiders and Chargers, the NFL also considered San Diego plans involving the Chargers, along with San Francisco's potential stadium arrangement with ex-Mayor Willie Brown, culled from other proposals by several other owners.\n <br> But Wilf indicated to, as the league now hears it, that he will not leave until a stadium plan is worked out in Minnesota. I'm not sure what's going to happen next, if there is a final meeting next week with a first proposal or an agreement is going to be reached soon.\n <br> But the issue remains: Will they consider if it's worth it?\n <br> Here are what owner Ziggy Anslinger has to say about it on his website:\n <br> \"I strongly believe a new stadium option will be found for the Minnesota Vikings in the next year or so. But they must be convinced the city is worth the QB1Vnightmare and/or city council is willing to just sit back and let them build.\n <br> <br> <br>"}
