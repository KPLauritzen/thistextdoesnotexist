According to the the AFP story , Will is taking legal action against a Chinese company for selling to consumers fake flowers \u2013 the topic of his piece. This stems from his recent article, 'Independence at the Crossroads: Introducing Indian Colors: A Modern Twist on an Ancient Tradition,\" in Rolling Stone. While producer/director Dudley Allan and his wife were struggling to save their relationship and pay off mounting debt, they discovered their birthday bouquet was the work of a fake supplier. The company used toxic chemicals, including flame retardants and lead, on fake flowers, to make the flowers look authentic. Allan sued the company claiming he suffered injuries, which can't be measured, from consumers swallowing flammable materials. Many market and manufacturer have claimed Allan's case is baseless, but one company was unveiled yesterday with a brand new fragrance to help people make informed choices. According to WSBN , this fragrance will be for sale in 2,000 shops and restaurants across the country. Speculation is that the fragrance will be named after actress Bryan Cranston, who plays Emmy \"The 'Breaking Bad' star\" on the hit TV show. The company calls \"Flowermate's\" fragrance \"An Open Letter To Sturgeon,\" and sells it as \"LIII\" cases of 100 bottles each. It also sells \"Flowerbeater\" to those that aren't happy with the floral bouquets. This exhaustive story might just set the working bees over the edge when it comes to buying\n <br>"}
