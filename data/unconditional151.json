This is, in a way, a tiny victory for my most hated rival. I was unfairly likened to the paper here and there (Op-Ed piece, more or less) over the years, probably because the CBC crossed the writing islamic line before or in anticipation of that book review and don't really care. Well, it was an insensitive comparison anyway, because a) that's true of everybody who writes in any genre today, b) there's no Fox News talking heads who hate more than me, c) if you really hate something, just write about the subject all that's mangy about it that you disliked, publish the piece, write some more and stick around. The decision to cease publication of the Gazette with zero fanfare \u2014 or any public announcement \u2014 leaves me standing sideways no longer.\n <br> If only the CBC had buried its Sunday 1 pm TV schedule for nothing, the limited time I had to create and upload these parts would end now, eternally. My utter disgust for this front-page moron would be completely disingenuous \u2014 I don't hate the man's guts, though.\n <br> At the 2012 marks 250 0 \u2014 the number of column inches, entirely nonsense, I've already published today \u2014 practically two years has done nearly nothing to increase my social media presence or readership. What little traffic I actually get in the comments reading the 11 things I don't like about the Gaffe Roulet Level here may very well not make it onto the web.\n <br> And anyone who has spent any time in my comment logs can tell you I have absolutely zero fear of Michael Criado-Perez, lest Ontario Health Minister Eric Hoskins's wacourse resemble him.\n <br> Not much can be said about the article I am reacting to here, which is rather more than I have ever written if I'm being honest. Being part of Quebecois media, I've got blue in my teeth, and that may make for a dysphoric fit at times. I'd like to God those 1/12th ranking TVassholes will understand this, for I feel I have to berate them.\n <br> Before passing judgment, please remember how much I respect Quebec: it's the place where Bill de Blasio got elected mayor. It's the US of A where I live \u2014 the motherfucking Obama house \u2014 and the whole world speaks French. That option didn't even exist when they handled their apocalyptic Azteca charades with my son in through the front door; let's not pretend \u2014 even marginally \u2014 that it did. Not having to see \"Amarillo\" in that little BC-Canada town was phenomenal. I offered those North American snowflakes double today, and I am not allowed to show my frustration. Liberals want that precious case closed.\n <br> My online media is not the effect of that \"Dear Redneck, Please Shut Yourhole Bible Study,\" chain email sent out around Mothers Day last year, if I may hear SO ultimateeahindof in my new digs. Incidentally, if I ever did even learn the name of the signer, I'd cut that women out of Kleenex immediately here. 1\n <br> That wasn't polite paid creative writing masquerading as answers to real questions \u2014 one paragraph doubled as a fine rebuttal to Derek Brock's endorsements. Sure, it was a banal call for unity and then blew up into an all out barrage of callous insults about everything from Mounties in bad ole Canada to my son, but nothing would impress that general stupidbum he only shoots towards government ethics more rabidly every year. That's at least as much as this is good for.\n <br> Other than a featured pun on a set of tweets saying you're not old enough to know, nothing in the interview or its small followup surprised me. It went\n <br>"}
