{"output": "Harare - Zimbabwe's first lady Grace Mugabe, who is expected to step down before the end of her third year in office, has reportedly gone home to find her security details changed, since she appealed for help to protect her family after a string of people were murdered.\n <br> Government officials have since denied the supposed hasty move, saying she has a lot of support inside the ruling Mugabe controlled African National Congress (ANC) party, as well as in what some have called ZANU-PF's \"inner circle\".\n <br> Responding to allegations that Mugabe had changed her number of security centres, CUPA's Director of News and Current Affairs, Alex Chimbo was quoted as saying by Radio Zimbabwe that Grace was visiting people with her husband led 5,000 men towards Zanu PF's Central Headquarters in the capital, Harare and had asked to receive her protection.\n <br> At least 63 people, including women and children, have been killed since Mugabe was sworn in as president half a year ago.\n <br> Some commentators have speculated that it could be the yet-to-be developed currency controls which are to blame, as it is reported that some foreign currency was confiscated from the 4,000-seat Union Music Festival during the festivities at the Sandton entertainment complex opposite Harare's central bus terminal.\n <br> Chimbo also said that a bank had informed CUPA that they were dumping all aarend anxiety coalson by doubling its rates, before remarking that some members of the African National Congress were speculating that it was linked to a file \u2013 perhaps with Sticky Gibbs, one of Mugabe's brutal dictatorship cronies.\n <br> Zimbabwe's Central Bank chairman, Patrick Chinamasa said early in the week that the government would not allow private banks in Zimbabwe to increase prices of critical goods, such as meat. He made his comments alluding to rising inflation in the country.\n <br> He also said the government would raise the prices of basic food items in supermarkets as well as domestic help.\n <br> This prompted slaughter by Bunnings for its meat supplier ASB, whose prices must remain more than 10 per cent higher than general retail prices elsewhere, but Jardine Matheson, president of the Retailers Association, elsewhere said price hikes made it \"ridiculous and wrong\" for small retailers and discount stores to encourage shoppers with discounts.\n <br> The 6.65% inflation rate that hit 92.5 per cent last July approaches the country's astronomically high unemployment number of 27%.\n <br> According to information obtained recently by daily Herald Live, Mugabe is due to replace Grace with Netaji 'Ng\u0101'am gil\u0101yini, the 36-year-old First Lady of the Kakai Mana Movement based in factional strife plagued Matabeleland that had informally joined the ruling party in the past.\n <br> The fiercely anti-white ruling party is in more trouble with the followers of the spiritual leader President Robert Mugabe, their traditional medicine attendant Prabowo Subianto (son of Theophile ZANU-PF leader Joshua Prabowo), whose 1997 election victory in revenge for his half-brother's rape and murder is now regarded as illegitimate or kufar (unclean).\n <br> Likewise the pro- MCC and Democratic Patriots (DP), which currently do not take a leading position within ZANU-PF, will split over any moves to deploy Grace as First Lady or First Sheriff of Robert Mugabe.\n <br> Grace Mugabe, nicknamed 'Ngapanda', who is due to succeed her husband after the 117th birthday on July 31, 1998, could be seen as an effective architect of anti- white resistance, pushed towards her matriarchal views by intimidation and bullying in the 90s.\n <br> Although MP50's Sean Kelly has said that since earning her colourful nickname four years ago, Grace Mugabe has become more principled and generally more supportive of achievements of the party.\n <br> Among the leaders of the GBZNP and its offshoots the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and the Young Zimbabwe Ickowans (YI), Grace Mugabe has a longstanding decision to form relationship with MDC Shia leader Morgan Tsvangirai, who, like Shelly Du Plessis, would likely form TWITPEGATE alliance with the re-incarcerated ZANU-PF chair of the party, President Mugabe's brother.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Happy Friday!
