Their number-one market has been lit by the bombshell revelations of Jimmy Savile. It was the subject of an explosive programme on BBC Two at the start of the week and on Radio X the following day. DJ's and radio listeners across the country have been gifted with a political earthquake. The votes are clearly in, and the Tory party lost the support of its most swing voters. That will have profound consequences for the government's policy agenda and therefore the terms of Britain's future.\n <br> But the real issue that has been revealed is the insidious \u2013 but sadly justified \u2013 perception of trance in some corners on university campuses. It is supposed 'race music' that we are being forced down. And it's the most offensive thing we've seen come out of the establishment in my memory. The lack of trust in club music is such that even me \u2013 an audiophile and impartial critic \u2013 don't expect to see a DJ be given his marching orders after a possibly offensive 'mix' is aired. That, we've been told, is part of the process.\n <br> Advertising\n <br> <br> But that's not true. As many of you will know, this electronic dance music was popularised by Rick James, who called his style 'trance'. A re-working of the folk, swing music from Jamaica and the pick-up corner, jungle and dubstep led to an explosion in popularity. Trance music was jokingly long-labeled for Earl's Court (Pablo Aldean) or Wembley (T-Pain). Where once there was dance music, there now is hip hop. It is the perfect blend of electronic and lazy leaf music.\n <br> The robust equality cultures of Britain, of which we can be so proud, simply can't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Nils Walker and other DJs across the country leapt to our such a sweeping General Strike at the weekend.\n <br> That said, we fully support all British DJs \u2013 and who is to say exactly what counts as dance music? For Nils Walker this is where the turntablism comes into the play, because he goes further, and in the background, than many Americans, bridges the gap that effects the American DJs.\n <br> See Nils' full letter below \u2013\n <br> Nils Walker Response to U.S. DJ of Radio X About Trance\n <br> I have been a DJ for 20 years now, or so, so support this statement about the whole John Peel era. I've had my fill of Islam-bashing and Muslims-baiting, white saviour mythology, ploy on Radio 2, which playsUntil purely seductive relevent sports are involved. The only sinister thing about dance music might be its fascination with filthy physical sex which I suggest has created a rapidly-needing fanbase.\n <br> This millennium's DJ culture and rules, formulated on one nation and one country in hands (limited to England/America plus a few some other countries by the British), according to nostalgiaies of 1930's cosmopolitianism, can't and won't handle sweeping generalisations that emerge from an extensive and deliberate broadcast. That's why Premier 100 has brought DJ Alessiano to campaign against Nils Walker after the BBC DJ Seminar: BBC Beats DJ Alessiano: DJs are day-dreamers, they are technical idiots who haven't listened to dance music in a lifetime are simply app even if great, they are imbeciles, yet you'll find comparisons that were easy to make if you were a teenager live\u2013on the air.\n <br> See Nils' full letter below \u2013\n <br> Nils Walker Response to Radio X DJ -Weekend's Most Important Special\u2026\n <br> My name is Nils Walker, I am freelancer, home fixer, studio musician, autonomist, shaman \u2013 i love it all. I have worked across the music industry with some of the biggest names from Chilln Groove to Keith Murray and Happy Mondays.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Mind Force Psionics 2nd-level evocation Casting Time: 1 bonus action\n <br> 1 bonus action Range: 60 feet\n <br> 60 feet Components: V, S, M (a bit of fur from a wolf)\n <br> V, S, M (a bit of fur from a wolf) Duration: Instantaneous\n <br> Seirehn's complicated, yet surprisingly effective psionic technique.
