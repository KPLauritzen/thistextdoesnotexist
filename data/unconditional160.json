You can room them with the long-discussed $850/pair Monitor Audio RSPA-200s, the $900/pair Reference Components ML-31s, or your choice of a low-power few hundred bucks in a fine all-in-one DACs from Onkyo, Denon, or Phonak. All look to be Pono-caliber accurate boxy monitors\u2014a wonderfully clean design fit for film strips, WOW boxes, pressure-sensitive film, and brightly lit condo buildings.\n <br> Which one does it best? For the 2012 Stereophile Pro Council annual labs roundtable, we decided to pit the Stereophile Reference RSPA-200s against a couple of partner monitors: the South Korean Tannoy DM780F and the MBL/Austere Dynamics MH501BR. Call me a sucker, because monitor cost correlations ranging from 2.25 to 3.25 are cited everywhere, but this was a reasonable number: Not a hat tip to anybody here\u2014I paid $882 both for the Denon DHT278s and Philips MBL-JL6\" midrange desk monitors\u2014but I'd also point out that the Stereophile Reference Monitor Company does not make entry level studio monitors.\n <br> They will, eventually, so you can get the Paradigm M616SS and Murat VP24NSWA modestly priced people monitors for around $400/pair.\n <br> Still looking for something between AR-X and some Aston Martin? $769/pair is a reasonable entry pair of dynamic monitors, as is a pair of the Mal's six-disc bookshelf models at $1238/pair. These make their round-table debut nearly all set to turntable, but I find these absolutely on par with any other high-end monitor sound. Very, very nice clarity\u2014I can hear a brushstroke on sheet music whereas I can't pinpoint a particular section, in complete contrast with a lot of low-end forking in.\n <br> I'm also finding a lot of detail that I would not have expected at $900/pair (see below). Detail, for instance, appears rich and quite distinct with the MBL/Austere Dynamics and with the old Schubert CDM150 ($1,049/pair). The above monitors are almost as much of a step down from high-end MBL made for CD samplers and scanners, but these are way ahead of anything that I heard before.\n <br> \"HOWEVER!\" (does sustained bread-baking sound disturb your silent boss!) I started shopping while trying to level my shipping partner's Neumann TLM 60s to that nonstick pot on my desk, and couldn't resist this one when it came on the shelf.
