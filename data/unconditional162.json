{"output": "Walker has a pretty prestigious entry on the R&B circuit, but this time she channels her inner Beck. She's using a vintage-looking Grado High Fidelity MKH30 pair to highlight the warmth that her voice can play \u2014 whether layered for a Streetwise knock-out or such a rich, biting cover of The Phantom of the Opera which could only sell the album as prohibitively expensive item in a museum.\n <br> MORE: New Mom Jennings Showcases Rap's Coolest Fetish (PHOTOS!)\n <br> Walker should be preparing to be a TV Storyline pick at some point, considering she graduated last year from Columbia School for the Advancement of Performing Arts. It was her sophomore year and she performed one year at the Consequences Of Famous Parents tour, but now is convinced that DJ Khaled is \"the biggest rap star in the world right now.\" She's going in with a full-blown April Fool's freakout about Khaled, in terms of madness just born of intent and assumed fame.\n <br> After putting B.o.B. on blast, Walker's become a whole lot more self-aware. When asked about using a vintage pair of headphones on say, a song which would be tipped to #2 on the Other Music chart circa 16 years ago and ensure a pop hit, Walker's not just going to dismiss the argument that Kia were charging outrageous royalty rates for the role. Instead, she reaches the final step in this peculiar duality. \"Ninety years old is in the middle of when I'm literally getting me a old pair of headphones,\" she says, making the plaintive smiley face into a chipper \"happy face.\"\n <br> So not yet fully confident in praise alone, Walker says, \"I probably just don't have my own platform yet. If you looked at any major politician on Twitter, I'm probably bigger than them right now. Like through my music, through my identity and my brand, through the awards. If she starts doing that, then she'll feel a responsibility to me.\"\n <br> What an attitude. It could also arguably be facetious. After all, the stakes could always be higher than good Nielsen numbers, and Klum has certainly thought about Tila Tequila having \"a platform, permission or rap credibility\" for the sake of money \u2014 and, frankly, all three factors lately are starting to get in the way of big ambitions. (We'll believe it when we get there. But let's assume for right now that the pressure of making stuff counts as a quasi-pareto advantage.)\n <br> MORE: 27 People to Watch at Next Week's Golden Globes\n <br> But if reality tv's taken a wrong turn lately, that's where House of Cards' Walton Goggins comes in. The executive producer, aka \"the guy who makes everyone else's idea better in seven seconds,\" is surrounded by an unshakeable confidence. Whether that's achieved by being good at his job or by actively wanting to dispel any notion that maybe the people around him could stand to lose their heft a little, is actually impossible to know. Do you want a safe job, or do you want to be famous? (If you're all about the money and you don't want to be famous, stand by for Tila Tequila.) Is taking time to spitten raps about Playboy Fame shit complete nonsense, or genius? (If The Wiz was cute.)\n <br> No, here it's our duty to ponder alternatives. Having themselves done pretty well at their jobs such as executive producing the best show on TV or dropping usually unexpectedly-bonkers fashion releases, Walton and wife Victoria look like it would be at home at the beach. But more important than just advocating for ourselves as Angelenos, maybe we might all learn something?<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Galileo Galilei, Queen of the Fourth Dimension\n <br> 11 NOVEMBER 2010-Razer rally movie tablet MR8ITY\n <br> Log in to Post\n <br> Following up on the first performance video of Razer's tablet monitor, this follow-up video shows the real-life usability of the Razer / Galileo computer hardware.
