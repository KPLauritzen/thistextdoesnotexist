The adult court in the matter, however, was obviously powerless to bring charges against Boudreau because the alleged victim wasn't 16.\n <br> Huffington Post legal expert Ken Sembach came up with the best answer one could give to Cuban after his attempt to attack the status quo. \"See [judge] Cynthia LeBlanc,\" he suggests, \"who served in the campaign of a competing candidate for U.S. president, heidegister Barack Obama of Vermont.\" Mother Jones goes on to describe the exchange grave Italian spread) you win in an iron grip, becomes all the kinder to victim-blaming victim-philosophers (\"neglecting to distinguish between instances where the teens amended their story,\" and \"turning the tables on Boudreau when he raised questions about the accuser's credibility\"), and doesn't object when Boudreau remains silent about the proceedings. But our wonder is saved by an anonymous \"young woman who was single and would testify in the matter if she could.\" She claims to have been sexually abused by a football player, and admits to having been at the jury selection when Boudreau had his horse in tow (\"the day of the trial, I had to go on a date with the judge and coworker who served on the trial\").

Tis the season for good molly around the Midwest by way of today's beat. The fight over seating a police car at a barbecue for local law enforcement can be avoided with a decent bottle of white WKD (psst, craft liquor drinkers, you can get that cheaper in Raley Field) and politely pulled from the service urinal at an NHL game. Sturgiss Thurman faced a bogus tax and still kept \"taking it deep as you know,\" watching Red Sox-Dodgers a year later and buying a house in Ellicott City hogging all the media attention.
