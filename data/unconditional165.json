The document type 'xsl' which is only available as HTML easily survives analysis as it contains metadata that is reflected within the XSL stylesheet. However, that image has screwed it up.\n <br> Upon clicking on the document image within the document you're handed a pop-over message that has prompted that you have no separate public domains or libraries assigned.
