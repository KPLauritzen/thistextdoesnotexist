A survey of more than 500 students at 30 British universities has found that among those who take ecstasy daily, 15 percent of those who take it daily do so for 11 or more days a month. Furthermore, among those who cannot use less than two pills a day, the share is even lower: 3.5 percent. The findings, which will be published in the British Journal of Addiction on March 31, are unlikely to come as a big surprise to researchers. Ethanol, cocaine, and other pharmaceutical drugs are widely consumed. And these drugs are increasingly prescribed by doctors seeking to help patients avoid withdrawal symptoms that occasionally result from stop-smoking medication. (We covered this topic at length earlier this month.)\n <br> You can see why this is that already: Ecstasy has been claimed to have no withdrawal symptoms, almost like acupuncture, and its therapeutic use is almost on par with nicotine patches. Never mind that the marijuana equivalent of going on prescription doesn't actually use any marijuana, and never mind also that the pleasure 5HT1A receptors are known to use are the exact opposite of pleasure from any drug harm reduction approach. That serotonin blockers and antidepressants are held up by their being nasty side effects near the stress reflex, and marijuana smokers who have tried the harm-reduction strategy of smoking up don't like being told they should have given up the pot.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> <br> It makes you wonder why the British University students decided to test their own three-day-per-month dosage in such a large and representative sample. (More and more surveys are now taxesiversity.) Frankly, it suggests a surprising glee at the temporary ecstasy-like diversion from the anxiety, vomiting, and deadlifting required to take ecstasy every day, and hints that all the fine-tuning students' minds imagine among itself waiting to notice a slight difference to take for granted in the MDMA-based pleasure experience. For those working hard to annoy human beings by taking increasingly large doses of any drug, indiscriminate use in a large sample where two-thirds of people at least once take it daily would be the kind of synergy of imitation of the drug it most wants these kids' heads to entertain.\n <br> Oh well. We still get over it and opine that every unpredictable chemical, when taken systematically, is best taken for that one time in one instance, and I don't think we can find any fellow humans getting smarter as they keep it under time-clock.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>A 1500 stick coopers gas canister, as lit by the view out the back window of a 1530 Range Rover.
