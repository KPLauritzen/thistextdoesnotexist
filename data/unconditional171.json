{"output": "\"We think they had national security information that they furnished,\" Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein told reporters during a press briefing Wednesday.\n <br> \"Therefore, we can't confirm or deny its authenticity,\" he added pointedly.\n <br> Experts say such cyber intelligence could be used to inform credible threats of armed attacks from south Latin America, which have surged in recent years. Such warnings could influence U.S. security agencies' decision to move ahead with bomb squad drills.\n <br> Despite the outcry and skepticism, the warning is hardly unprecedented. The Pentagon in recent days sent specialized troops into critical coastal cities to reassure the public that, despite Drudge, cybersecurity does not affect the system at home.\n <br> And a computer scientist at the government-backed National Institute of Standards and Technology in June told Congress, \"I can assure you that our intent in issuing the advisory has not changed,\" according to a transcript of the hearing\n <br> Mr. Rosenstein said that personnel at the door within 45 to 60 minutes were typically able to quickly determine if the alert was authentic and reinforce it in a standard report to the general public. But he said that the same message could arise from a variety of sources.\n <br> \"It's trying to tempt people. It's trying to feed people false information. People will take it of somebody just in case,\" Mr. Rosenstein said. \"So, at the end of the day whether the information is real or not, whether it constitutes a threat or has no threat, it's very important to make sure the public can remain reassured.\"\n <br> Mr. Rosenstein said there have been other online scams that served similar purposes, but none have been as serious.\n <br> Follow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n <br> He would not comment on who the madman might be, or how exactly the senator might try to identify him. If he cannot do so, officials say on Wednesday he or she could face treason charges.\n <br> \"Keep the door locked,'' Mr. Rosenstein said.\n <br> Want news about Europe delivered to your inbox?

Indeed, the Kings, an extended team don't just got better against their more talented matchup on Monday night, they fenced a competing bunch.\n <br> From a beauty standpoint, the Kings' heavenly relaxing team trailer hit another Poets John pop last night, birthing sentiments like \"Fuck the LA Kings with a 100 inch Manhattan from the apex of Union Theatres.\"\n <br> Congratulations to the Clippers on their 34th appearance on NBA Hardwood Classics, women's basketball's version of \"Super Bowl on Ice.\"\n <br> This is the only Emcee contest at which Lil' Wayne failed to make an appearance. The Los Angeles top boy still counts as a Legend.\n <br> Not only did Devin Booker stick around to participate, and gave Atl metronomic, textbook baskets, he almost worked L.A.'s Russ Smith. Only Smith failed to take the tiny lake is sprite by leaving a studied jack into Zen-ful Trick, while Booker thunks a pool rim in midair. Booker rose back to play on the next one.\n <br> Interesting we have a 78-0 Cowboy RB type matchup from our 12th annual Las Vegas Western Conference at Worlds? That has unfolded exactly as I described on Monday night.\n <br> I slide from finalist Final Four All-Star Sunday Jordan spitter at 7:04.\n <br> As Barker, my Splash Brothers, Cook and Charon [not the master co-conspirators] expected, Pfft finally uncorks his compadrable Apollo Creed-style sack shout: Two years \u2014 a\n <br>"}
