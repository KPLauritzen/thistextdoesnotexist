{"output": "Lucasfilm Head: \"What Has been Happening over the LastTwo Years is Not Good\"\n <br> With The Force Awakens recently hitting theaters and flirting with a record six-week domestic run, the transformation of Disney and Lucasfilm into real science-fiction lost a few followers (WrestleFans, Geek & Sundry), and now Disney CEO Bob Iger is having to discuss the impending sequel over a meal.\n <br> During a quiet lunch at New York's Ace Hotel with a couple dozen trusted execs, Ideas Executive Producer Dean Devlin candid discussed role models for future shiny robot warriors, CGI wizardry, and finally offers an update on the likely sequel.\n <br> Surprising no one, Iger did not like the huge box office numbers of 75% of the people in Wingertown that celebrated the film with him.\n <br> \"What is happening is not good. What happened over the last two years is not good,\" Iger intones, motioning to the men in front of him. \" We need to come back with something better than that and we will, because we're making the movie that we want to make. Every year we get better.\"\n <br> \"Oh my goodness, I don't know what to do in a movie business that's this turnkey and the bottom line is declines...\" for five straight years.\n <br> \"Right now, print is down, but TV is up,\" says Iger, gleefully.\n <br> \"Well, that shows how strong the Fox stock is, but let's not get carried away with that. We're just happy with our new thing, Star Wars. We made it to Leia. Four billion dollars worldwide -- and continues to grow and grow.\"\n <br> \"Like Kirsten Dunst,\" adds Queen, referring to the newcomer who gets the role of Star Wars' most annoying, over-acted space princess.\n <br> \"We tried to find someone to get the part like Kirsten Dunst,\" says Iger. \"And Bob to be fair, after Star Wars, Bob and Kathleen both came to me with a message: Is it possible you're done directing movies? I said yes. And Bob said 'they want to do it.'\"\n <br> Then he pulls out his phone, shows that PSA is him on a red carpet at the Oscars in 2009, and takes out his chief gig and forges forth.\n <br> \"Look, it's because also Bob is not in it for the money,\" says Iger. \"He owns the exact same company as the movie; we aren't traveling in separate planes, he's not making movies to order and liken to the movies he made before, he's just doing it all by himself.\"\n <br> \"Besides, The Force is just a part of whatever he might want to do next.\"\n <br> Watch the video below to hear what Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford have to say about the sequel and see how Star Wars: The Force Awakens ranked as Number One in over 90 countries.\n <br> -SD\n <br> WATCH:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Patief claim two of Western Australia's five May Games medals\n <br> Updated\n <br> Patief Hockey Club, the Big Sports Cascom Super Coach Challenge and the Bushrangers on Monday claimed two of Western Australia's five May Games medals after narrowly scraping out a narrow 4-3 overtime win over Sutherland Sharks.\n <br> All the anomalies of the game played at home in Perth on Monday evening were reverted to comedic norms with Bettin Rolling Presidential plates seemingly thrown in the air during the shoot-out with the crowd banging on their seats repeatedly.\n <br> The restaurant worker-turned-power-hitter easily walked into the Tuggeranong Arena about 10 minutes before tip-off bit to the cusp of the eight-ball, scored the metres and delivered a very hard bodging effort to seal the deal.\n <br> The finish was not quite the spectacle former Olympic leader Olympic Yearly Chief Mark Neeld conducted four years ago for Pattitude after London but it was a proud moment for a club handball players who have had a troubled history in recent times.\n <br> Coal miner Huggan Sok, 31, played 24 games for the club between 2005 and 2012 but could not last in the top level.
