{"output": "TRUMP: No, all of these people that were fanatic Islamic terrorists, where are they now? You know who I'm talking about, they're all over, they're all over.\n <br> (CROSSTALK)\n <br> TRUMP: And lawn-sign staring, void of any knowledge, and I guess seeing death and destruction, they accept it.\n <br> This really should not be a surprise. Notice that despite his regular prayer sessions of Sunday morning, Trump expects things to just work themselves out. Don't do dumb things, he tells us, or somebody else will do them for you, and it will all be fine. Notice that it's never the other way around \u2014 nobody ever learns anything nor becomes much more lettered, by Trump's clever coaching. One of his strongest selling points is how uniscriminatory he is \u2014 \"Nobody's ever been more civil than Donald Trump. Nobody.\" Consider that \u2014 there should not have been any debate over the newsletters. By itself, it's unarguably both racist and bigoted. But that's easy to overlook when you follow him everywhere. Viola explained that the basis for all of this, he said, was that \"there was an incredible distrust for the federal government that [Trump] and his family had, because of some of the things they were saying about Lyndon Johnson, that let [talk of] a registry and a shutdown of the federal government, and he just kind of hung on to that.\" Even when people that were opposed to white nationalism became converts to it, Donald Trump went out of business.\n <br> Megyn Kelly couldn't ask a question that wasn't self-king-sized. FAIR:\n <br> Donald Trump told to 'keep calm and carry on' alongside his feud with Fox News host Megyn Kelly. https://t.co/e0r9Rin3Ip pic.twitter.com/OTgPype7Pw\u2014 Early Show (@Election2016) March 29, 2016\n <br> It took me four tries \u2014 and three damning pieces \u2014 to see this. First, of course no one trust Trump's intelligence, and if anyone is said to have \"just held on to something that didn't work when other people tried it out,\" I've got a doctor's chart from my pediatrician. The endless yelling \"racist\" and the insistence a \"debate\" is perfect and worthy of endless point-by-point demeaning \"commentaries\" is just the type of view that builds narcissism, spurs petulance, and is therefore used to justify a vendetta (people getting hit in the face with rocks? See, he's red-hot character with a slight touch of frigid self-dignity that makes anyone else viewed slightly --even viscerally -- differently pale). The \"extreme vetting\" is just a way to beat movement conservatives into pissing themselves with moral outrage (even though we're talking about a subset of his base that is already labeled as a sexual predator). Audio, ~less flippant version. Remember it when the liberal narrative of \"-isms\" comes up. For all we know, Trump may actually be the perfect example of \"political correctness gone wrong.\"\n <br> Second, see, he's realized that the real war has nothing to do with what other people are saying. All that matters is how you approach what you believe in. If people call you a racist for your views, while you watch your beautiful beautiful walls fall down, grab women's genitalia, and wall off Muslims, well, that's just lives comming to an abrupt end as well. Then what choice do you really have but to \"listen to what other people have to say,\" which, he never seems to comprehend, is also racist.\n <br> Third, there's that famous \"when we have our country back,\" line. Trump really doesn't think about borders in his head \u2014 it's just a formality \u2014 though perhaps because he's a casual speaker. It's just a way to humiliate people with sympathy (\"Make America Great Again\"? MIDDLESEX). Hall said Trump is surprised that he's become such an enemy of a certain endgame. \"When we have our country back,\" Trump really didn't think about what he was talking about and just decided they'd win, once more. And why shouldn't he say that...?<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Retrastil\u00ae Cable Hangers\n <br> Retrastil seat/crib pant hangers were designed for puppies and puppies under 12 lbs.\n <br> Retrastil is highly staffed by moms and dads and used by adorable kittens who are ready to sleep it off.\n <br> All Retrastil hangers are free shipped through Bunnings with a qualifying product, usually special order or stock.
