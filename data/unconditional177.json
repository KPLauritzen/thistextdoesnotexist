(Photo: Kim Klement, USA TODAY Sports)\n <br> The Cleveland Browns' roster is thin at running back and wide receiver.\n <br> But there's someone trying to save their job: backup quarterback Tim Tebow. The former New York Jets star has been impressive in training camp, and Coach Rob Chudzinski is sticking by him, even as backup Brandon Weeden has been a revelation.\n <br> Although Chudzinski hasn't ruled out trading Weeden in the coming weeks, he's sticking by his backup. And it would make sense.\n <br> \"I think he's deserved every opp,\" Chudzinski said Tuesday. \"We know there's competition. There's a lot of guys who don't play there. But we're not trading any [Montario Hardesty], Aaron Maybin or anyone else. Nobody's rested.\"\n <br> Chudzinski added that Ramsey Peterson, the backup who has three receptions for 41 yards, looks \"structurally sound.\"\n <br> Previous: Kerry Collins ready to pick head coach\n <br> \"You never know with that,\" Chudzinski said. \"He's going to hit a slump where he doesn't come out right away and become the healthy guy. ... Those guys have a lot of football left. They're in the fight for a pickup.\"\n <br> The Browns opened training camp 3-1, but lost their first game 34-14 to the Green Bay Packers. And they haven't had that much chemistry with Weeden and Brandon Thorn, their two other guards. By cutting Hardesty, who had become the team's secondary clown. Weeden said he expected to be \"tested\" running behind DT Phil Taylor, not Turbin, who resulted in -11 yards on 15 carries against the Packers.\n <br> On Monday, Hardesty took over for Paul Kruger in this starting role. It's a role he's not too thrilled about playing.\n <br> Tebow hasn't been offered a contract extension by the Jets. Realistically, the Jets better hope we throw them in the garbage and keep him in New England, where he started with Tom Brady and Jonny Evans and finished his career.\n <br> As much as he's encouraged to be around the team, he also understands that the Jets won't be giving him the opportunity to shine in an action-packed five weeks.\n <br> Tebow wanted a long-term deal this summer after wanting 16 years to sign with the Jets in 2011. The team is hoping Peterson will ultimately split carries, and if they can find good value in the market, Hardesty could possibly become a backup for a year while Jackson expects No. 28 back Chris Johnson to take the next step as the \"go-to guy\" in his offense.\n <br> Tebow clearly wants a bigger role.\n <br> \"They're sure talented guys and we know there's competition for spots,\" he said. \"That's what they promised.\"\n <br> Follow Jim Reineking on Twitter @jimreineking\n <br> PHOTOS: Best photos from training camp<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Please enable Javascript to watch this video\n <br> EGRETTA, IL -- It's a war over homeless veterans. Federal officials and advocates say things are moving in the wrong direction for those who benefit is benefits.\n <br> Little Beach Preserve Commission Senior Specialist Wanda Wiley says the authority has been creating new housing for the homeless veterans by providing them with much needed services, all designed to prevent homelessness It's been a long time coming, and it's only been through a lot of dedicated work, along with social networking, that the military veteran's mission has now reached the high officials.\n <br> What surprised the Davis County public official was just how little a buck. The petition that's been sent to Presiding Officer Dale Cole and others will eventually cost taxpayers around $12,000, according to the Davis County Treasurer's Office.\n <br> Coalition for Veterans Against Homelessness Denton saw this a way too long ago, and it's the reason why more than 5,000 veterans signed \"Northwest Indiana Man Takes Veterans On His Bullock Pant\" to make sure GoFundMe was paying it forward!\n <br> Wiley calls the veterans movement of realizing one family needs help is something the community's taken on.\n <br> \"It's a lot of people putting their lives on the line to help needy veterans,\" she said. \"Well, what about our needy community and what about our community at large? They take a stand for homeless veterans.
