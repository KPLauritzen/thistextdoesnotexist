Under pressure from a strong Moscow-backed government and the ongoing political chaos, President Viktor Yanukovych has largely evaded talks with European leaders. But the tide is changing.\n <br> On October 10, Ukrainian parliament approved reforms that explicitly recognize arms control treaties, over well-reported objections from the Russian foreign ministry. The Senate in Moscow on October 24 unanimously approved export permits for Rosoboronexport, the Russian state arms trader. At that meeting, Ukraine primarily talked about oil and gas and European Union integration trade issues, in addition to the demilitarization issue.\n <br> The last of these topics \u2014 a defensive calamity division acknowledges the realities \u2014 moved Hillary Clinton between Vladimir Putin's recent strikes in Syria and Ukraine, and her statements in early September to Washington's Jewish lobby. In letters on September 1, 3 and 18, as evidence mounted that Russia is creating new war zones of chaos at Putin's orders, Clinton said, \"While Russia continues to offer hollow pretexts and conspiracy theories to justify these military gains, Ukraine is still under crushing and destabilizing occupation [from Moscow].\" She continued:\n <br> Russia should not confuse diplomacy with acquiescence to the unacceptable demand of an armed attack on Russian or Ukrainian soil. For Russia to succeed on ever doubling its gas exports in the next three years, Ukraine must expect no end to pressure to change its vote, its territorial integrity, or its government. Russia must stop eliminating peers like Georgia and Moldova to obtain these objectives, and instead move with great determination and without indecision to fulfill its responsibilities beneath the [Bastion] Shield.\n <br> <br> You should not, I repeat, not ask Russia to come work with us to strengthen the independence of Ukraine's government. [Note: please note the emphasis on the post-partition Russia.]\n <br> <br> Believing that the U.S. \"cannot compete\" with Moscow now, Hillary responded that Ukrainians needed to prepare for war with Syria, Moldova, and likely Georgia (which it makes sense to land in Ukraine).\n <br> Political posturing aside on core principles of arms control and the free flow of information, there is ample reason to applaud the steps that Ukraine has made since EU leaders in late August proposed military aid plus trade and support at the United Nations Security Council, plus a panel process.\n <br> Avoiding Armageddon requires that all sides resolve issues quickly by working through comprehendible terms on the basis of consequences for each other: immediately reduce NATO then cease hostilities. Might Russia respond to an abrupt change by war? Sure, but what if it made a big mistake or caused other nations to misread it as a provocation?\n <br> What happens in Ukraine once the smoke has cleared? In conclusion appears in the anti-military operation by Armenia, which adheres to a state pressure and a civil defense policy. Russian TV has shown footage of Armenians lighting a giant pile of wood on fire and burning it with torches to call attention to government incitement inside Armenia.\n <br> Will Vladimir Putin go that way? If he does, or sticks 10000000000 irn with people he portrays as his enemies, what of the very dangerous consequences beyond Ukraine?\n <br> \u2013Robert Flanagan, founder and editor of Volokh Conspiracy, teaches at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Introduction\n <br> SSD is the de facto standard-bearer for flash computer storage.
