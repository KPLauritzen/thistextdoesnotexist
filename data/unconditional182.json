{"output": "I bought my Seiko SKX007 digital tidal chronograph on 14-09-2013. This watch was the spotI bought it to suit my own tastes, a decent meet and greet with friend, a fancy meal in good company.\n <br> I didn't get the watch after that but just for fun i looked about, i found another expedition watch called Odonia PCB Sequential Resistance Special Edition 2005=22. It the same watch but black, i think it's called \"ranacadie BRAT-092739 and many resellers sell it. What does this have in common with a bezel diver? Nothing other than the fact that it's made by Oyster and Odonia. These watches were produced in 2006 and this one is in 2008 but they are identical and in the same size. Also they both have a stainless steel bezel and a bezel tempered Sapphire crystal.\n <br> I bought my 276 (no 1918) without knowing that the seem compatible but then i even thought of buying the second band but i was not from Australia, so i bought this one instead. I now have the marine bezel and it has them found in both watches but uses different mechanisms.\n <br> One of my question about this see's my comments on this watch.\n <br> Which coincidence? hence i ask.\n <br> Because they do look similar and just by the fact of personal taste,and the fact that maharaja's use it also got me to buy this one and i regret not doing so earlier.\n <br> Any opinion or advice help me wondering...Or i could google this for more information..<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>(The two-week long Philadelphia legislators-only ride was originally meant to be held on June 18, but was postponed because Philly already had one of the most popular rides of the modern era. Catch it now the rest of the year!)\n <br> For the past two weeks, the \u0141amek Ch\u0142uchowski Memorial Ride has been a staple on the calendar for Philadelphia riders. Usually on Saturdays, the ride starts in South Philadelphia and travels north on the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, traversing Strawberry Mansion and Luther Burbank parks and back, creating a loop reclaiming the streets of the wife district for the positive act of cycling. Recently, the event has expanded to Knights Plaza. Other segments have included Avenue of the Arts, Fountain Square, Sansom Street and McNamee Street.\n <br> For its second year, Philly will dress as its \"badass ambassadors\". Stefano Fogolo (Andorra), Kate Klippenstein (LA), Dex Easton (Wycombe) and David Kilgour (Sydney) will complete the ride together, wearing balloon animals and rapidly moving cabs representing their city.\n <br> Also bearing a green square top are #ChewerGut (New York City), @JaneFish (Dallas/Fort Worth), @Snoochie (Houma), @ToddMountainHeart (New England), @BambiCam (Colorado), and @grumpy_giant (Atlanta). Michele Mazzacane (Courier-Journal) will take photos, Jennifer White will spin yarns at the finish, and Armine Khalil (Cleveland) will give readings from poems often adapted from from Carolina Jean Font and Conrad Williams.\n <br> Another version of the ritual began in 2009, when four cyclists each rode up the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and back.\n <br> By night, the streets become painted with fluorescent dots representing a different area in the city, growing farther down the road as you wind through suburbs. When it's time to pack up, approximately 600 - 800 cyclists roll out motorcycles in a big black Wurlitzer flanked by helmets covered in Cyclocrosses.(And notice the insignia on the getaway truck.)\n <br> Finally, the riders converge in Columbia Square as the evening waxes old with style at line dancing, Tenzin power walk and a massive pancake break. Youth scramble to join the celebration while older riders sit in silence, together, breathing in the tinny soundtrack of BMW's \"Mot\u00f6rhead\".\n <br> Over the years, the \u0141amek Ch\u0142uchowski Memorial Ride has drawn, popularized and funded walkable streets. Each time around, it is fun and easy for second and third generation Philly cyclists to identify with, otherwise known as \"Afrofuturists\".\n <br> MY PHOTOS:\n <br> 2017 \u0141amek Ch\u0142uchowski Memorial Ride. I am here by bike in my classic jersey. The riders are made up of cyclists of African descent of varying success. Most of city rocked the black tie, overcoat Italian. One guy must wear a Berkeley sweatshirt Smiling and carrying spare tube. Sreek tweeted before he starts the ride that this was probably the goofyest looking protest they have ever organized in Philly.\n <br> City comes together for \u0141amek Ch\u0142uchowski Memorial Ride,Philadelphia- for the dead, journalists beautiful Whoehler instagram.\n <br> Bride, yes.
