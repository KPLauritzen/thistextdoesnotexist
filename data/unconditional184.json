{"output": "The-sudden-death football simulator: John Ross and Brandon Marshall disappoint in New England\n <br> Want your team's prospects appearing in weekly Huddle Up columns? Enter your information here.\n <br> The preseason doesn't officially start for the New England Patriots until Week 1 at 5 p.m. ET on Thursday. Two weeks before that -- and just over a week after quarterback Tom Brady officially signed a contract extension through 2019 -- New England is still a mystery.\n <br> They can't seem to settle on a single receiver, despite this receiving corps returning seven starters and putting Tom Brady's five Super Bowl-winning receivers in the Super Bowl in more than one of his 31 starts.\n <br> What's the deal?\n <br> \"It's been a question we've been trying to answer through (eagerly) and try to address every week with Belichick and (defensive coordinator) Jamie (Lynch),\" Trevor Siemian coaching assistant Nick Rolovich said.\n <br> Spokesman Stacey James said the coaching staff is \"frustrated with a lack of trust and a lack of consistency in the efficiency of four and five guys who have huge big-play capability. We get the double threat or the running back. We don't get the man coverage (receivers), which is where me and manager John Ross came in.\"\n <br> Ross, a 22-year-old undrafted free agent, has been asked to become Brady's favorite receiver, particularly after Dewey McDonald (montrealap) left for the Titans, Brenton Bersin (miami miami) didn't return a friendly call, and DeVante Parker (shinShin) is out with a hamstring injury. Coach Bill Belichick discussed Ross in the start of the preseason, but doesn't feel confident one way or the other at this point.\n <br> \"There was an Alex that we've had and Nick, and we've really wanted to use all of them together and really utilize everything that we've upgraded from the leaves, from the receiver room,\" Belichick said then. \"I think there is time and we will continue to watch people. But right now, the connections and the chemistry and the rapport with our young players, we are not where we want to be,\"\n <br> Former Patriots running back Shane Vereen was asked before Sunday's 42-8 loss to Buffalo what he thinks of the veteran three-way receiver trio of Ross, Tavon Austin and Phillip Dorsett.\n <br> \"I first had really high hopes for either Ross or adding pittsburgh because I thought dorsett should have made that time as well and where's dorsett? People have gotta get back-up,\" Vereen said. \"I think Ross actually might be the third guy in that three-way \" They're shallow there and it doesn't look like a real clear rotation might be coming.\"\n <br> The Week 1 rematch vs. the Bills is expected to go much more like that. If the roster isn't settled, there's a reason Belichick said earlier this week, \"We'll get there.\"\n <br> \"Rob Gronkowski,\" celebrating making it official three-time Super Bowl champion can't play on Thursday night. Gotta feel for ya, bro. \u2014 Kyle Rudolph (@KWR3D24) August 23, 2016<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>+1 Share 8 Shares\n <br> Someone recently sent me this awesome app called the \"FeedReader App,\" which basically aggregates all the important information you can think of: a recent Oprah Magazine, weather, magazines, songs played, dogs browsing on the Dogster, and more.\n <br> These are all information that you basically throw away; that is, once you read the article. So why the option to solve haven reallife a little messy?\n <br> A while back, I created an app for FeedWriter, which was pretty cool. However, many of the things that third-party do is very simplistic is my opinion. To solve the reallife problem- where there are too many websites, sites that do the same kind of obsolete things \u2013 is that many local and regional sites have very stale content.\n <br> So, a Plan B.\n <br> In my case, my primary work was designing the cards for a car rental app. So, I like to be able to observe things from upon weeks, leading by weeks, attracting a real trace of the business. To some extent, that is what the app does.\n <br> However, there is an important part of this plan B that can't see the light.\n <br> I don't know about the rest of you guys. If you simply see the big picture taken up by the live assets, feel sucked away and don't read further. So you want that long piece that includes the blog post link to the company page. You get the office location printed on the card.\n <br> This is what that pretty much entails, is finding markers inside websites saved on different websites. Ads are easy and effective \u2013 they only lead to where desired, they navigate users, you receive some good\n <br>"}
