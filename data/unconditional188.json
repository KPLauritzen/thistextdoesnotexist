It takes in fully kosher food and provides it free to hundreds of homeless Bronx residents each week. Other than that, it's mostly filled with clothing, trinkets, old board games and toiletries. Animal rights groups donate their kitty litter and IHOP throws in a free sandwich once or twice a month. The rule says the goods must not be used for drugs, however, and some clothing we just can't help but try anyhow. On this first visit, I spotted some throwaway remains of a pair of sneakers. I got down on my hands and knees and refused to throw them away. Our manNYC groans an audible \"no.\" \"Maybe a ham sandwich,\" Azure, who memories boost sure answers me. The episode would eventually take on an existential quality as I peered into kaleidoscopic loops of the still attached shoelaces dangling from the case, as if trying to be quite yet earnestly forlorn. \"It looks like a pair of rainbow brave-yToes from the start, then you notice they're all wicked yellow, and then rainbow-yToes come into view, crystal-blue, and I just can't stop thinking about them.\" A look at Azure's face tells me she already is thinking about them right now, running through her brain with their vibrant orange glow. It's like I'm spiritually descending into the opposite dimension of my poor ignorance and diagnosing a schizophrenic with temporary ranch gum disease. \"How long have they been there?\" \"Fifteen to twenty years.\" \"During that time what about those colors did change? Have ink stains now or ugg boots?\" \"I checked, these super Seahawks Ever held ended in 1973.\" I am shamed, shamed. \"And so when they kicked in, that's when it detected Vicodin?\" \"I checked.\" Azure's fears are confirmed as they go on to show me how the colors reacted to all the weed. In years to follow we would play a riveting game of \"Where's Vicodin!\" picking the most alarming pair.\n <br> Candy store \u266b Its like that for houses \u266b We drift dizzily apart \u266b Two sorts of carpenter \u266b Where that process starts \u266b NO melody at its slightly.\" If I'm ever faced with any of my dreams's outlines \u2014 such as the opening text of an I Love Lucy script from the 50s \u2014 I know I can have a song that comes to mind and which applies beautifully to the situation at hand. As (for the record, not all stoner/junker jewels are completely accurate but most are honest enough) these lists make for pretty catchy playlists when I'm out and about. I do not, however, impose these requirements on myself. All I ask for is a fuckin' narrative as to what my canon is.
