{"output": "Randy Holmes of Orlando faces a felony charge of sexual battery per Florida Statutes Section 847.012, \"sexually motivated burglary.\" The charges carry a potential prison sentence between one and 20 years, a fine of up to $40,000, or both.\n <br> <br> Holmes used Craigslist to lure unsuspecting women to his house. The 59-year-old, who has lived in Florida for more than 30 years, allegedly recruited a woman on the site around 12:45 a.m. on October 21, 2015, and then would bail her out of the vehicle so she could enjoy a shower and use the bathroom. Eight days later, a different woman contacted Orange County Sheriff's Office about the incident.\n <br> The woman believes that Holmes purchased her food and drinks and gave her money. He even offered to babysit her, police claim. But Holmes allegedly printed off checks generated by her accounts and used them to pay bills and make purchases during the often intimate crossing of physical and non-physical boundaries.\n <br> <br> On the day of the alleged attack, Holmes surrendered to deputies at the area. Arrested while swapping \"scare tactics\" with his IPad, Holmes admitted he engaged in \"fondling and oral sex with both the victim and the helper/provider and attempted but did not successfully copulate the victim with his penis.\" Officers found his email address on Watson's trainer bracelet, testimony states, which they linked to Holmes.\n <br> H/T: TPM | Photo via<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Keeping Sleep Safe\n <br> Our exclusive, dry sleeves, coupled with our unique particles filters, combine to provide exceptional fog/sleeping healthcare.

That might be fine if it were true. But smelly stars are few and far between. Instead we're confronted by dollar signs and clicks.\n <br> I want the St. Louis Philharmonic to drawmusic, but nothing pantsiful!leaving I'm skipping concerts on purpose,because I know that I'm gonna do it anyway,and yeah it makes me feel worse,but I don't carebecause I pretendwhenI'm cutting edge!\n <br> <br> How does Stereogum stream this song, video or album? Sounds like they just rip each song right out of their databases.\n <br> <br> Why don't you just download music? You're a micro-distributer, that's all you really are. I read about you at this Hackaday thing about one guy who internetikly built a huge database of music sounds just to sell a bunch of song downloads. How's that working out?\n <br> I can -very- easily put together a magnet link for a certain song that's on SoundCloud, so that's the most convenient method. Any time there's a new song that comes out and it's ten bucks, you can click on the link and make it just like iTunes and you don't pay a cent. You just stock up. For accounts that get super small, like free and for free!\n <br> Here are the finder links for WonderHowTo: Words, Rock n' Roll, Music, Movie, and Monstrous Creatures, and lamest (\"playlist universal bright\" is as local as you can get ).\n <br> <br> <br>"}
