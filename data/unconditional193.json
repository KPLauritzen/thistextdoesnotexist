{"output": "Watch Netflix Specs\n <br> We've found all of the latest Netflix streaming specs down below!\n <br> Each one starts off with the hardware specifications, some of which are the same for all future Netflix hardware, which means you won't find any specific hardware requirements. And it is easy to find the total number of channels you can watch on Netflix.\n <br> BlackBerry Devices\n <br> As mentioned in the unofficial parameter for apps, we could use the native Netflix app on any device that is running a BlackBerry 10 OS implementation. We were able to perform the same tests on the BlackBerry PlayBook as well, a 5S. So you don't have to worry if your favorite mobile OS gets updated in the future to be compatible with Netflix below!\n <br> iOS Devices\n <br> While there are no BlackBerry 10 related parameters (only app name/brand/browser), in order to find the total number of channels you can watch on Netflix, we first needed an IP address. To do this, we used a Firefox FindUsBtc extension (available for free in the app store) and the Safari extension of Chrome. Then, once we got this IP address, all we had to do was click on the Netflix icon in the notification bar, which would pop up a mini interface of the Netflix website. You can find the minimum and recommended OS requirements below.\n <br> Android Devices\n <br> Finally, to ensure that every device on Android put together with varying versions of application software creates a consistent viewing experience, our free boost sure download app to get a new device, and added an additional device more than 175MB to the total maximum number of channels that you can watch. This test took us 10 minutes for iOS devices and 2 hours for Android devices.\n <br> iOS Devices\n <br> Android Devices\n <br> Trivia Question: Is this the wrong movie?

Lastly, if your answer is 'no', check out another list to check out the top 100 selected movies from the same series, or they all happened once.\n <br> Updated: With the exact result not available, we've left the results in their original order.
