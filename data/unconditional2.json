So when it comes to the iPhone's next generation, basically every chipmaker will be utilizing \"higher-end characteristics\" in part of the production process in order to deliver up to 30 percent more processing power for more impressive performance and battery life. And it's not just a matter of using new packaging materials; Apple will be using a second generation LCD touchpanels as well.\n <br> Posted at 9:18AM Sep 17, 2015 by Drew Johnson<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Carl Cloud\n <br> coach Does skeptical attitude play a role in the execution of interviews and activities?
