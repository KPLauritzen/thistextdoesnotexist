{"output": "Shown here is a method my wife and I developed to help get us and/or our children back on track after a rough episode in our lives. In doing so, we discovered a much greater sense of community, connection, and \"being there\" with other people, who have been just as lost or rocked by life as we have been.\n <br> * Required<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>CAMDEN, N.J. \u2014 The NBA trade deadline always provokes massive action.\n <br> On the outside, it looks almost like a season-long television marathon: Every deadline day a flurry of big transactions could plug any variety of holes, give any number of teams a boost.\n <br> The real weirdness occurs in the middle. The NBA is a league of rarest of rareballs. In the million players in its system \u2014 five who have been cut, one inactive, one roadkill \u2014 no one is truly system-proof by dint of good looks or experience alone. As the Cavs lose for the 15th time in 18 years and the Rockets struggle to whoop them, a rare combination of bad luck (good teams lose in the playoffs, by the way!), bad timing (the unseasonably warm March, and package developements) and old-school dysfunction has given teams an ultimatum: Cut the player you have now, or be a postseason laughingstock.\n <br> And while some teams brave the path of panic and cut their players, others delicately whet the public appetite, ideally raising even more expectations for the future in a financially all-but-impending rebuilding effort.\n <br> So, with the final month and a half looming on the horizon, here is a quick look at the salary-cap landscape in the Eastern Conference:\n <br> \u2022 If the Cavs decide to go into the offseason with Dion Waiters' $12 million contract, they, as a team, would have about $17.7 million in room \u2014 which is where the Rockets finished the season. (Even if the most you offer the backup point guard on a one-year deal next summer instead of a qualifying offer, the Cavs wouldn't, would they?) The reality is, even with the injury to LeBron, if you're the Cavs, it's best to put Waiters on the shelf now \u2014 as best as possible \u2014 before diving into the shock-and-awe free agency market from which the four Cleveland teams (L.A. Clippers, Boston Celtics, New York Knicks and Milwaukee Bucks) could potentially benefit. Let's say the Cavs do nothing, of course. Through their first 283 games since 1995, they're 137-63 (the other 99 during the salary-cap era in Cleveland are in the rafters. The Jets are there).\n <br> \u2022 The Bucks are really counting that Marlon McCree second-round pick. The Bucks don't want to use it on another first-round pick unless it has an upside, or if they believe in the promise inherent in it. In 2016, it has a little bit of upside. In 2019 is when it really starts to come on. Let the real, natural Marlon McCree begin to emerge.\n <br> For what they offer him now, Milwaukee, unlike the first report, is not desperate for perimeter shooting, bench players at all. The Bucks have five starters between them averaging 10:36 per game; Patrick Beverley, Monta Ellis, Jabari Parker, Brandon Knight and Malcolm Brogdon pummel opposing defenses.\n <br> The team, from what I've read and heard (Baxter Holmes is reporting), would not sell long-term at this point to Braylon Hinds or Terry Rozier or anyone else who's irritated their fanbase. And in general, 300-pounders with shooters, printers, deity or firing linear CBs tend to run red flags in organizations.\n <br> The Bucks, with $36.9 million committed to the 2017-18 cap, might as well fire their business manager for his suggestions. As for the potential value on Harris, Milwaukee's value is already dropping off rapidly; they could be one or two wins away from challenging the Bucks for the Bucks' wild card spot.\n <br> \u2022 The Knicks are no longer a 6-month marathon kind of team. After August's new NBA-related regulation changes and the removal of Derrick Rose's mid-range jump shot from his arsenal, New York simply can't afford recent synapses to the nervous system to carry over into the most basic mathematical calculation of their squad's future attractiveness. Good luck doing that with the loss of the mercurial Carmelo Anthony and meanness-prone J.R. Smith, and the person to blame more than any player is the process of evaluating the team in this accelerated manner. With all hands, this is unspeakably good. If Rose, Smith and Anthony re-sign, this is going to be the second-best global market in basketball. It smells like a rebuild, of course, but this just feels like the Knicks just won that kind of lottery \u2014 we'll\n <br>"}
