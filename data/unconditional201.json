{"output": "Getty Images\n <br> The Lions released offensive guard Larry Warford on Friday.\n <br> Of course the Lions weren't done.\n <br> The Lions announced that they have signed running back Theo Riddick.\n <br> Riddick posted this on his Instagram account:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Trouble centers on the development Hex with the abuse that the hentai Mooks had been into recently. He begins experimenting on Hex, his little sister that he's affectionately called Donny, and and somehow Hex develops supernatural powers. Along with this comes a further rise in his abuse of the sisters, Hex expressing a fondness for crack. Written by suzieriot<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The Dodgers had howled at the loss of Greinke. The Reds blew it up. The floor tumbled down and out from under the season when the Rockies and Cardinals traded for a deal. The Braves, Cubs (and possibly the Phillies) had been shopping Anderson.\n <br> At last, one of their own was sitting there, and he got the free-agent investment that seemed a cut above the rest: $80 million over eight years, with a $31 million vesting option for 2019.\n <br> No wonder the Nationals and Phillies agreed to proposals that would have been universally ridiculed. I'm not talking about $79 million over seven years; they were worth paying about $184 million, especially with DeAvila likely supplanting Mike Rizzo as the team's manager.\n <br> No, my intent is to find a deal in the sub-$70 million range, higher than Mat Latos's deal in Indy, Adrien Garcia's in Baltimore, Freddy Garcia's in San Francisco, Mike Bordick in Cincinnati. The John Lackey trade was offered in February 2012, and I found it hard to believe the White Sox would have tolerated the $60 million he got.\n <br> I believe Garcia was offered close to $115 million, with a $10 million signing bonus, at some point in '14. As detailed this week, Garcia's new deal with the White Sox, according to ESPN's Jerry Crasnick, does not provide such a luxury -- even if the White Sox have considered Mike Napoli to represent its hitters.\n <br> Garcia, 23, might not save them much money -- he doesn't throw very hard (he was unavailable for comment Tuesday night), and they're about $100 million in the hole going into next year -- but this is a solid prospects-for-prospects trade, with Garcia prospect players and established ex-teams. Give him five or six of them.\n <br> The Reds are getting a promising star, and the Rockies are getting a consistent third starter who could pitch to both sides of the plate, keeping both lefty-swinging Manny Ramirez and righty-swinging Brandon Barnes from siphoning off innings in the bullpen. Also, Garcia sets up the Rockies in a way that not even GM Jeff Bridich and/or GM Jeff Bridich's famous smart-team-with-no-human-being consultant Larry Lucchino could have anticipated.\n <br> To put it this way, Bridich is playing the Orlando Magic. Once the doughnut joiner decided in October that pairing Troy Tulowitzki with Troy Tulowitzki was an idea worth seriously considering, the whole Magic franchise picked up his tab. The answer could be found in the tunnel.\n <br> Colorado will eat \"certain costs\" (Colorado baseball exec Kyle Kirschner says) for Garcia, in the form of $4 million added with five minor league backstop players per season. Rockies GM Jeff Bridich says deals like Garcia's can work for a team not considered to have enough financial muscle. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred was not surprised by the Giants agreeing to the Cardinals' the Lester deal Monday. \"It's just another type of outcome,\" he said after meetings with the Giants' coaches and executives. Why this Joe Maddon deal now? \"They're going for it,\" as MLB Network first reported.\n <br> To protect Garcia, Southern California could have offered him big league service just to keep him from leaving, per Huntington. En route team decision, right? No, because they bring back a solid pieces to complement him. The Rockies might make some changes in the rotation. The Rockies stand to save money over four seasons with Rockies starters throwing at least 30 innings every year from 2016 to 2022. So, at least, Rockies fans are not grieving the loss of their #1 starter, unless you're DeAvila.\n <br> And, yes, he's not the only guy they've lost for good. Rafael Soriano got a Biogenesis-assisted shot in Fernandez's shoulder, so he's out until 2015 and, at this point, probably No. 5. Dustin McGowan is a year away from unrestricted free agency, with no understanding of his likely role as the head of the hitting coordinator. The Rockies might donandenmashi, which is a Japanese baseball slang term for cleats that resemble ski pants, and go out swinging. The Vel\n <br>"}
