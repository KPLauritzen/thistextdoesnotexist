For comparison, a day on Earth is around 24 hours here and our planet normally receives about three-and-a-half A-types per year.\n <br> The number of weapons-grade rocks that have already been discovered illustrates the potential danger toward where one might choose a rocky object to \"attacking\". Adam Sicilian, NASA\n <br> JPL/CalTech scientist Adam Sicilian, an atmospheric-optics expert, led the project which has looked at movements of plutoids, the most likely size for near-Earth rocks, from an orbit around Mercury.\n <br> They found that rocks made up of a preference for dense matter should be \"unstable, forever\", he told BBC News.\n <br> This would add a slight disorientation to the orbit of an asteroid, which would probably trigger changes into other orbit, or more vertigo, he added.\n <br> And as gravity would be vastly stronger at the equator, rocky objects at that time of year would be gravitationally locked to the Earth for about 90% of their life - rendering them unusable.\n <br> \"Given that things like meteors oscillate in power over time or if they are disrupted, there could be a lot of gravitational instability if you spin an object back and forth, whereas things at the equator cycle in power over an impressive amount of time,\" Prof Sicilian said.\n <br> \"This indicates that a weapons-grade asteroid is about the size of two swimming pools, and we want Earth to be nice and quiet.\n <br> \"While the number of weapons-grade rocks that have already been discovered illustrates the potential danger toward where one might choose a rocky object to 'attacking',\" he added.\n <br> Asteroid threat\n <br> While Prof Sicilian's study looks at asteroid trajectories of motion away from Earth for a few hundred millions of years, impact scenarios could readily involve more complex systems such as spin-up of clusters and rocks to speed up their disorienting orbits.\n <br> \"If an asteroid falls close to Earth and spins up in a complex way the whole Earth could tilt off. It would take a long time to oscillate back and forth in this disorientation. An average distance between Earth and the perturbed rock of 3.4 million km puts Earth way beyond the range of impact.\n <br> \"This means that an asteroid with a diameter of about 55 metres will be free of severe perturbation less than a single month after it can no longer affect Earth.\"\n <br> For comparison the average Earth-bound asteroid small enough to pass within about 5.3 Earth diameters of the Earth would slow down and power down quickly after impact, as would a \"super-reactor\" cloud of carbon rich gases.\n <br> Any perturbation on impacts which would have changed large asteroid trajectories likely exposed the planet before the rocks impacted, said Nicholas McCarthy, scientific director of NASA's Near-Earth object Program.\n <br> \"We won't see the damage from a reverberating impact sampled for decades, lol,\" he said.\n <br> \"Even the oceans would not escape the impact in a globally catastrophic tsunami as the Yellowstone steam plume saw last year.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>(CBS News) NEAR THE French-German border, trucks sporting strange-looking bottoms are being inundated with migrants causing them to tremble.\n <br> Some of the scared braved the foreboding early Saturday morning on the France-Germany frontier occupying a busy feeder road between English Channel ports.\n <br> Similar tales over the last few weeks have been heard, but with the influx now increasing to almost 13,800 migrants in August, French government authorities are concerned about one incident in particular.\n <br> TEHRAN, Iran - There are over 54,000 Iranians currently barred from crossing the French border into France, the Iranian foreign ministry said in a statement carried on the official IRNA news agency Sept. 3.\n <br> The United Nations refugee agency said in September that 130,000 Iranians\n <br>"}
