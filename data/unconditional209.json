The PRGI is 100% nylon and 100% permeable. We've added an anti-microbial added to our canvas to help it stay smooth and clean. These colours are available in red, blue and black. Be sure and check our Schnell reinforcement feature to ensure your PRGI is the best shirt for you regardless of colour or size.\n <br> Quote from Johnny Frinch, PRGI product manager\n <br> \"In our experience this material is superb for all summer wearing and weather conditions. It forms to you and is less expensive to replace than a synthetic strip. In front, you get maximum breathability for wet situations by packing even a bit of air into the fabric, for the benefit of your neck and shoulders, but also thanks to space saving for your inner shirt, making your trousers appear smaller. If your passenger seat rides up or wind overpowers the handle bars you don't have to wrestle with the plastic strips that can sometimes develop horror claw marks across your cheek, shoulder or upper chest!\"\n <br> We think it's pretty gross. For a moment we thought the PRGI was a joke...<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>A Colorado Springs police trainee who created a sketch of a Nov. 13 violence in the Mall of America was fired two days later.\n <br> <br> Capt. Jeremy Lewis used a police sketch to draw K-9 \"Cazorla\" but never gave it to officer Matt Charette, according to testimony at his trial at the Arapahoe County District Court.\n <br> The police department failed to follow rules in releasing Lewis, who was 17 at the time, the Denver Post reported.\n <br> <br> Charette testified he had the sketch of Cazorla enlarged several times and looked at the end of it but didn't remember as much as other heretofore revealed information, such as when Lewis took the sketch's pen off at the top.\n <br> VIDEO: Wounded Colorado mall shoppers describe being doused in pepper spray\n <br> Lewis, who only listened as his lawyers described his painful legal nightmare, was fired Sept. 26, 2014 after new information emerged during the trial. Circles showing on the sketch corroborated witness statements about what happened to Mall of America shooting victim Johanna Jackson, the Post reported.\n <br> The district court action manifested in records released Tuesday, though criminal prosecutions are on appeal.\n <br> \"It was my mistake,\" Lewis told The Post. \"I'm taking responsibility.\"\n <br> An argument ensued between Charette and attorney Raul Salinas as Charette had followed protocol. Cazorla had conclusively been identified as a full-bodied dog through DNA, a standard procedure, and Charette went hunting for best practices, before poring over Lewis' sketch. The problem was Charette was looking at two different sketches.\n <br> Witnesses affected by the tragedy testified during the trial about how Jackson climbed out of 16th and Woodstock in a wheelchair and fell, suffered life-threatening head injuries and died.\n <br> Charette also testified he has left information in his report inconclusive because he'd been mixed up in conflicting data sources, both investigating the spate of mall shootings.\n <br> <br> RELATED: Mall of America employee says he found a severed crime scene shirt<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Merfolk\n <br> Pathfinder #7: At Sea, Part II\n <br> by Ed Greenwood\n <br> Wraith and Sea\n <br> When northern piracy spurs a sudden skirmish with the Bretonni over the ragged baronial castle of Erutanum, Leeron Nuangon\u2014last of the best Ysgramorogar\u2014spends his downtime fishing in the eastern Bay of Dragons.
