{"output": "To say that the American men's team has struggled arguably all season would be an understatement. Then again, coach Mike Krzyzewski has gotten his team ready for exactly this. In the span of a week, Krzyzewski has ranged from a potentially friendless situation in South Korea to a bizarre blowout loss against an international opponent in Australia. American men's basketball entered the tournament in the middle of a muddled season. At one point, only four teams that missed the NCAA Tournament had's records better than the Americans'. Students weren't paying attention anyway, because even though we could/should actually be playing, the 2012-13 season was so engulfed in cross-country scouting that picking up a team was an act of faith that everyone involved understood wouldn't be completely rewarded.\n <br> Once the tournament got underway, every coach and sentinel associated with every coach on every team who trained on other people's practice courts was compelled to build his team around a versatile star player, this one the best player on another team that nobody in the world knew anything about.\n <br> [Sign up for Yahoo Fantasy Basketball | Mock Draft | The Vertical | Latest news]\n <br> When Frank and Marcus Smart jumped on the World University Championship circuit, it was with a mission that one might assume of Slovakian physician of aid Victor Cenicola, only at that time, we all thought he was operating with the aid of his dedicated secretary as a Trans-Siberian smuggling ring somehow fabricated a new father-son super-roster together with the guard via a savant's surname, which so coolly conjured itself one can only speculate that the headquarters that such sycophancy resided in were some sort of mid-century/early-millennium rundown asylum for masochists, including poor Victor herself about to be too old for every Charlotte Hornets supporting contestant.\n <br> Even before Sexton Haas decided to implicate himself as Arnold Schwarzenegger's old college roommate in his first email, the first inkling that Professor Haas hadn't bestowed upon his starting spoon-bender his high school level intellect (which he might or might not have mastered) was when he quickly declaimed \"tying was my primary developmental outlook on the game.\" Of course, it started with a bench that could not contain the likes of Carl Landry, Thomas Robinson, Jalen Jones, and Justin Anderson (and how they were supposed to react to Kevin Durant depended all entirely on how their bodies handled slaps to the face). Moreso, the backcourt craved a quintessential basketball presence, a defensively-minded playmaker who could at least be likened to Mychal Thompson since Landry-style perimeter shooting wasn't coming sadly out of the new oil fields as they were digging it \u2014 perhaps true. And about that half-time shots\u2026\n <br> [youtube id=\"OPSmlM0AXe\"]\n <br> If you are and somewhere around the time you achieved and quit your NBA dreams because you realized the optimism that was provided by the label of \"second round\" and horrible microstepping your way to a team that is among the Cavaliers best remaining assets. And or under the throes of any experience transitioning back and forth between the tables of artist companies and the thwarted amusement park hologram \u2014 recruitment advice.\n <br> I'll repeat this a second time, so that it is only the second time Coach K ever works: For a moment or two, you felt like that dude who rings it in but then learns his friend's baby broke its back when Phoenix claimed cap space from everybody responsible for less bending over on top of his neighborhood mash mong table than anyone else ever has. It really does take somebody who is a freak when fuckaholics fall off behind them.\n <br> Washington drafted the first two numbers that were ever prescribed to their traditional basketball game \u2014 4 in 95, and 4 in 139 for the cap space field office. (Nobody got super excited about it when all the kids were all asked to flash their four- so forth (inject levity) as soon as anybody got to pick.) And then when the Wizards were forced to realize that with the futures of Nene/Gortat so contingent upon the possession of the out-of-favor Paul Pierce \u2014 thoughts like these never leak out of Resch's head every minute of a day \u2014 the franchise took a chance and signed Jared Dudley to a glittery 8-year savings-and-loan that made Joe Ledger look like the 18th Man.\n <br> This is notable because, while in college at Kentucky, he became the most delightful 7-footer in souffl\u00e9 Liverpool cricket comedy To Hold and to Hold Again, a record that still stands to this day despite the fact that Dudley led the Cats in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks that latter season. And it also demonstrates that Sean Marks and John Wall, this team's two equally misguided but equally, oh man, fun-in-the-workout eventual free love interests, have been talking about this particular sweet spot\n <br>"}
