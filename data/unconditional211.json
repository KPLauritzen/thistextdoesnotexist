{"output": "You can't beat the fragrance of warm pumpkin pie in the morning. There are no cooking tips for this, you just need a baked good to snack on while you go about your day\u2026then dig into an oatmeal butter and cottage cheese cooled pumpkin pie bagel for a sweeter treat.\n <br> This whole pot of oatmeal butter and cottage cheese combination is so delicious! If you're wanting a little bit more time in the morning then stick around for 24 smaller bites (or one larger bite) of this pumpkin pie bagel.\n <br> We spend a lot of time when eating and consulting recipes online. However, if something doesn't turn out the way we always expected, often we just go back to experimenting. This was kind of the same way I felt when I had no idea what to do with diced sweet potatoes.\n <br> You're a smart woman, right? You're aware of good ways to cook and the quickest way to do something. Right?\n <br> So you go on with your regular route. Even though it didn't turn out as you knew it would, just because it hasn't gone exactly how you planned doesn't mean the end game of it is worthless!\n <br> You got over that phase of not wanting to do other things for a while then voice it feeling ungrateful. Now you know the so, so secret ingredients that are right for you, and you're going to use them to your advantage!\n <br> This whole mini-batch pumpkin pie bagel was exactly what I needed to open up more opportunities for experimenting, especially when it comes to food supplies! Pots help a lot as Christmas presents, and now that I have a bunch of use out of them then the extra \"just in case\" carries on.\n <br> This pumpkin pie bagel uses your water melted down with olive oil. You can also use butter, but make sure you design your bagle in just a straight line. The spiral is a bummer if you were taking pictures too as the butter won't show through!\n <br> Note: This entire recipe is really easy to make! I love simple things, but when you are having trouble simply double the recipe and go home and get to doing it all over again.\n <br> Be sure to try these Pumpkin Pie Bagels!<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The boss of Britain's biggest carmaker has been dismissing threats from Tesla Motors that it will build a battery storage facility in central Britain if the Government refuses to provide supporting infrastructure.\n <br> James Parker, chief engineer for Jaguar Land Rover, produced a formal response to Elon Musk, chief executive of Tesla Motors, which has developed a \"gigafactory\", said to supply batteries for 3,000 electric cars a week.\n <br> While Teslas and other electric vehicles could be made in the UK using existing manufacturing facilities, Mr Musk told a business breakfast in London on 17 October that Tesla employees could be stationed there, with more hours and benefits, before the firm begins its own battery factory.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> Within hours, Tesla had written to the Natural Resources Secretary, Liz Truss, explaining that it needs a vast battery factory to beat out its German rivals. If the government fails to step up a substantial commitment to support battery manufacturing in the UK, Mr Musk said, his company could aim to build the factory in Lambert, 30km (18 miles) north of central London. His letter was addressed directly to Ms Truss.\n <br> Jaguar has one of the largest battery bays in Europe. In October 2012, the UK government awarded it more than \u00a365m worth of grants to help launch a battery storage business focussed on electric vehicles for the grid, universities and industry. The project was announced two years ago through research by Jaguar and its partners at the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership to assess the potential for a Britain-based battery manufacturing hub.\n <br> Two years on, Jaguar has won \u00a343m in grant and support following a programme of up to \u00a345m given to support Tesla's European sales. That teardown $100m factory will look to use renewable energy to produce and deliver batteries, storage and power up cars to owners.\n <br> James Parker said: \"The battery business is key to success of our future consumer businesses in electric vehicles currently being sold in Australia and other markets. We have a team of 50 employees and we believe an industrial park close to each of our UK head offices that can envisage a large-scale battery manufacturing operation, learning from and applying knowledge gained elsewhere in the world, is hugely important to our future competitiveness and success.\"\n <br> Read next Tesla is pulling out of BatterseaPower, a solar farm in west London Tesla is pulling out of BatterseaPower, a solar farm in west London\n <br> Jaguar's position has triggered fears that it could become the victim of a Tesla move to set up disused British engineering stations as a battery programme, creating thousands of jobs.
