It's in our DNA. But what happens after we bring children into the world? Don't get me wrong \u2014 I love my four furry friendlings \u2014 my kids especially \u2014 but I'm also a big proponent of keeping pets. After all, it's a natural, evolutionary law we'll always have a desire to keep an animal on our ownership roster.\n <br> But when my wife and I decided to have a baby last year, we decided to skip the traditional way of adopting a pet. No family or friend is going to commission you to raise their pet. The adoption is solely on you. Adoption fees for our beloved cats at the Honolulu Humane Society ended up being about $200.\n <br> We didn't want to rely on anyone for help raising our pets. This is not our everyday life.\n <br> But we're also fundamental characters who like to plumb the roots of situations to draw resolve. And that's what we did when we started an Amazon Wish List to buy toys, blankets, provided by Petco. (Note to Amazon: these pet supplies will sell out by the time you publish this story.)\n <br> One gift of which we were so very sad to lose was our young camper named Nick. In his eight years of life, Nick had grown up to become in some ways like his father. But out of the blue, owner Surprise gave Nick to the three of us for sleeping in her office behind us. It would've been great to keep Nick close to place, but happy memories alone do not a lifetime make.\n <br> So, what about adoption? Thanks to people like the KaplanSpiral\u2014founded by Harvard doctoral student Janet Egan Mazur \u2014 there is a huge market for a replacement for the trillion animals living in shelters. The nonprofit organization vets and breeds nearly 2,000 potential dogs and cats an hour.\n <br> The KaplanSpiral has agencies and organizations in the U.S., Israel and Europe placing pets worldwide. So far, they've placed 6,000 dogs and cats in 204 countries. Sadie Wood, the president of the nonprofit, told CNN: \"I fell in love with animals very early on. I was in the zoo as a kid and that was all I ever saw. I thought it was an amazing part of my life, and so I wanted to make an impact on that.\"\n <br> I immediately fell in love with animals very early on.\n <br> Mazur realizes that it's up to animal owners to hold animals close, which I totally support. And I totally recognize that there are instances in which the adoption process is not right for you.\n <br> So, whether you want a change of pace, a reminder that animal goodness lingers or a chance to rescue a laden stray, adopt now.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Madonna\n <br> Published: Jan 24, 2014\n <br> The University of Manchester has taken a major step toward allowing women to study as full professors in the arts, humanities and social sciences.\n <br> The decision was made earlier today at a meeting in London.\n <br> Students at Manchester, however, remained divided over the move, with some wanting full credit and others wanting the deal to be ended.\n <br> \u2022 Victoria Wood: The making of the Queen of Pop<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The Justice Department first argued that Cuba had justified shrinking its prison population in part by releasing \"ballot box prisoners\" in elections.
