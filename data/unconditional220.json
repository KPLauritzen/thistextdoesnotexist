{"output": "We're still waiting to see even a close-up look at one of the new consoles of the Xbox One (High-Def Gaming or HDR) and PlayStation 4 (4K Gaming or High Dynamic Range) \u2014 and according to Microsoft, the wait is nearly over.\n <br> I spoke with Microsoft corporate VP of marketing for content marketing and marketing, and senior media advisor Gary Steinman, at the Microsoft Media Japan major television event in progress on Monday, with regards to both the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. They did not seem concerned about the lack of total in-store footage of either the Xbox One or the PS4 at launch.\n <br> The two execs did admit, however, that data will show that we will see higher res images for the Xbox One immediately after launch, but also noted that games won't replicate the high resolution images you see on current televisions.\n <br> \"As the data (that's already coming back) comes in, it will confirm what we've said about the end of the journey \u2014 whether it's a lot of things are stopping it from being truly 4K, or next-gen, anyone who doubts us probably should look into it at some point,\" Steinman said.\n <br> When asked the difference PS4 vs. Xbox One 4K Gaming vs. HDR, Steinman was not yet able to clarify res, but did note this will also be the case for the console's current game collection \u2014 but stated categorically that 4K gaming is in after giving both consoles a try.\n <br> The Xbox One will launch early in the holiday season, on November 22 in North America, and units will start shipping at the end of that same month in Europe.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>I suppose the only possible objection is that the sucker-punch someone punches or kicks towards me anymore is not likely to be someone who has done this action before.\n <br> At various times throughout my life, I've been shot at, threatened with a knife, raped, molested by fake police officers, hit with a basketball \u2013 deliberately \u2013 in my front garden, run over by a truck, stabbed, slugged by a yeshiva rabbinical student who misgendered me (he wound up on in the most traumatized state of mind imaginable) and even stabbed in the back by a police officer (the actual charges were served both before and after my suicide ) when I was tried and sentenced for a crime I had not committed.\n <br> Such punishments involve meaning and supporting a narrative, which puts the children of Israel at risk just to be inscribed in the present, human population consciousness. In a different context, these punishment might be considered necessary, which is why they are prohibited. One of the things that I would like to do, seeing as this isn't given me any space in the society I live in, is organize anti-punching campaigns that give weight to the rights of people who actually hate me.\n <br> The brilliant Agnon Kronin, while laying the blame of the attack on Connor pacifies people who think that they won't have to die three times in order to carry out their revenge plan\n <br> One of the things that I'm not very happy about is the tragic lack of outcry and struggle over the impending new life that is going to be torn apart. But there's no way to make light of such men. At this stage, those who have attacked me want nothing more than to know the extent to which I will be massaged or humiliated or suffocated in any way [31]. I am profoundly concerned about the physically damaging togetherness which the recognition of identity mavens create for other men in the society. And it is almost all of organized religion that takes this form the majority of time.\n <br> This, however, leaves no solution and oh none, however one thinks about it will do. Coming up with the salvation promised for all, the beating of which is meant to be a social marvel or the ''taste\" of which is meant to be a social poison, is, unfortunately \u2013 as Samson said \u2013 ultimately meaningless. On the basis of the theology of saints that I study, the passing statement that is left is that the old character is healthier than the one who now transposes it. Consciousness writing is the traumatic end of zero-sum relationships.\n <br> Lightning will indeed strike and the newly created boy will remember his birth for years to come and he will also remember his beloved and the others who wanted to separate him from them. But the unbearable knowledge will be indelibly imprinted. There is no return to an indifferent, yes-sayers world. When one is traumatized, one senses the end behind things and from that point, it is determined that one just walks forward and the roads are never illuminated.\n <br> Reading the discourse about identifying the 'true victims', a result of the unconscious intrusion into the consciousness of all who are involved, one is probably tired of when people pretend to be outraged when they are nothing but the depressingly habitual ones. I'm very likely to receive more '\n <br>"}
