{"output": "About\n <br> The Base Game Concept & History\n <br> I've always loved the theme of base building games, and designing a game with specific themes in mind seemed like a good idea. Everything from focusing on a specific part of the world to developing a game around magic or maybe even a dark and historical theme seemed completely fine to me. So I took a good look at the base game top down and the three previous games published by the company, one in 3rd edition and the rest two in 2nd and 3rd edition. After a lot of time and research, I came up with this base game.\n <br> After a lot of concept work and some alpha testing, I've finally decided to turn this technical previous attempt into fruition.\n <br> I'm currently renting studio space that's about to be torn down. In addition to that, my furniture/business will also need to be rented to be able to actually pay all the taxes/fines that game costs. However, after I finish launching/funding this project, I intend to be able to start booking full time studio space as well as project fees/transactions. This will give me more time found to use to implement features and incorporate new and innovative ideas.\n <br> Risks, challenges and FAQs\n <br> The \"Kickstarter Risk\" is the day I would meet a disappointing challenge or obstacle that may delay this project if not worked out in advance. This is only possible due to my limited resources.\n <br> An example of a bad Kickstarter Risk, is my mother goes through severe health issues and needs assistance requiring specially fitted equipment to move from one room to another one. I cannot let a child of my name suffer such severe privation as to be unable to move further than a few feet per day, let alone to a living room without assistance! I have a hunch, despite the fact that I'm in this predicament trying to raise money from supporters, the amount needed to undertake such an effort will prove emotionally and financially difficult to deny my mother in terms of solutions to any such issues.\n <br> In the unlikely event that my mother goes through any immediate heavy challenges (e.g. car breakdown, shooting accident due to a suicidal act) I would ask that backers at all within reasonable symptoms of physical or mental distress, take any back Up meals, told by me prior to making their pledges. I propose delay the launch of this project for a day or more. This would allow everyone under consideration insured and consequent to possible talent talismanic healers to convince their sick assistant to eat to their full ability.
