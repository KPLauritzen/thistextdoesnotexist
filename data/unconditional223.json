{"output": "From this site (http://www.sexual-health-info.org/articles/countries.html) we get updates on .pdf files. Over the past week I've been advised that from 2 May, 60 countries (including the US and UK) will no longer support Open Data. This is bad news, not for health information in general, but IEMs as IEMs are not watered down by Big Commerce. I've heard plan locations popular with pollsters are being cut off for this reason. (This and other IT issues are already reported, many people are finding these reps from the Odo meir and they don't seem to understand Open Data.

Government standards that regulate lifespan, recalls and manufacturing defects will work more freely because two different agencies will be involved.\n <br> This past week, the EPA simplified its permitting process surrounding those kinds of recalls and a decade-long original equipment manufacturer recalls that manufacturers say would have prevented fuel tank explosions. And because large vehicles carry a much larger amount of fuel, companies less liable for a covered problem or some factory defect may also be able to avoid liability for incorrectly manufactured gas tanks.\n <br> EPA Commissioner Gina McCarthy said it was time for the agency to \"move beyond reason\" to make better rules. \"Some time, well beyond 2017,\" she said, \"we'll be looking at a bottom-line approach to how we rate recalls. That will help us understand whether we've met our mission.\"\n <br> <br>"}
