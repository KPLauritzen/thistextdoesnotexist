{"output": "StarTrack opened over 60 years ago with what may or may not be the only desire to build cars for men. Now six former employees are on a mission to change the dynamics of the automotive industry. They're building some tasty cars, demanding that people find them.\n <br> THE FIRST\n <br> Scott and Jerry Hennessy, who met working in the audio industry, decided to work at StarTrack Motor Products after Mitchell Kinnier, the son-in-law of the second founding founding patriarch, bought the business, then in its infancy. There were three other mechanics lined up behind Scott and Jerry: Doug Hinchey, a former Nascar driver; Brad Miller, a Ford engineer; and Mike Paige, a live-wire who had helped assemble StarTrack's most notable customer. The family could have opted to keep eight on board. Instead they filled that seventh spot. Scott's wife Laura promised to bring with her her daughter Kim, a primary school teacher. Deanna, the pair's son, whom Scott had adopted, was headed home to Australia for the holidays. Scott and Jerry also asked for they would need rest for what they were calling, before they could call it a day, \"the most exhausting, important time of our lives.\" Laura's eldest son Jeremy had a final exams, having simply finished the buddhist portion of his Philosophy of Life. He left, but not before ordering a tequila stereo system from Rotterdam's House of Blues. During the race weekend he wouldn't open until Friday evening, and the customer had already pre-ordered a ride. The customers. Allan Hux-Donner and Judy Erbished, a couple from Seattle, were StarTrack's three first customers. Judy had moved from the west coast a couple years earlier to watch her lover won the NASCAR title.\n <br> The Hennessys realised that they would have to make themselves known among this new breed of customers. The idea inspired their evolving pulping dance, around hot pots of stew on a bluepicker with a cup of J\u00e4germeister dangling from each montage. To the casual observer the Hennessys' outfits might have been patronising representations of the craft that consumed their muscular bodies. Anyone who's observed a vintage mechanic, British or American, for long enough will recognise this behaviour. \"Given the Dickensian scale of the failure, it's not a stretch that the only way a mechanic can bestow any kind of hope on a journey like this, is to talk crap and try to dance amongst the corpses \u2026 But these three would be the absolute cynics in doing so; the eventual audience is all the dead and the dying.\" Steven Wiltshire<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>remember Brian Otto's vaulted raft ski and trad climbing?

However, there are increasing reports China is reverting back to fake food imports.\n <br> \"Fake food is making its way back into the Chinese market. It may get more popular because prices are cheaper, well regulated and the quality seems just the same as the real deal,\" Brian Lai, China marketing manager at M&B Internationalfoods, a leading food and drinks safety firm, told Bloomberg in 2016. An increase in counterfeit food and drought shortages could try to remedy the slowing economy in China.\n <br> Over the past few years, the Asian nation has begun to crack down on food manufacturers manufacturing fake food or dosing up on toxic chemicals that might land in the body. According to Reuters the Chinese government has outlawed the sale of chemicals that are ineffectual or harmful to people's health or cause difficulty in one's duties.\n <br> \"We need to guard against food imports that are fakes or dubious, and we certainly want to further assess products from overseas,\" Shanghai Zhongwen Capital Group director Jui Luo Fenam told Reuters in 2016. \"We don't want to rely on guesswork and just trust whichever company we've dealt with\n <br>"}
