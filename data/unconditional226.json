No peace.\" Mr. Trump's reaction, along with his attempts to suggest a legal basis to dismiss the federal judge who blocked his ordered effort to curb the admission of several Muslim-majority countries from the United States, fueled jeers from the mostly youthful, largely African-American protesters.\n <br> The idea that black and Latino residents, mostly powerless during mass incarceration and an economic depression that hammered a white system, receive blanket protection from bodily harm throws hope into the void, observers and experts said, pointing to (admittedly rare) civil rights victories.
