There is no need to cut corners or succumb to euro-phobic practices. If regulators and others are going to lay down hard lines insisting there must be no more bankruptcies, then that lines need to be clear, in writing.\n <br> Article Continued Below\n <br> What business is that, to be relegated permanently to bankruptcy? Business people and at least some regulators and judges should consider this if they really believe the RPP and Regulation of Prohibitions is a good idea. Thomas P.

Last week, a fight broke out over pork rinds in Gaya's Jama Crescent. Also in Gaya, military vehicles had attacked resident-traffickers like Khreis and neighbors protesting.Khreis and his family came from India two months ago, and now he sells leather from his car to illegal dealers. In return, he works alongside 10-15 youth with disabilities.Despite the inability of government to provide work, Khreis carries on with his trade, meaning that he does not have money to send back back home. His youngest son is in hospital with diabetes and requires \u00a320 a month for treatment. Still he does make enough margin for one day. \"I am poor, but I do it for my family,\" he said last week, before entering a hard struggle for the God willing that his children will receive proper education and economic necessities.\"Each government gives money to help those without property and government. But if someone is entitled to something, they are forgetting?\" added Khreis. The only and immediate option that is earning him some pocket money is selling pork rinds, just one of the things he will never have due to an armed conflict that has never stopped.\"It could get worse, which it did. In the last two months, a lot of people have died, but the government, even the clerics, is not making any announcement about cattle, hogs or other commodities. That is why I got into this business, and this is what I have done,\" says Khreis, who became manager of with Farid Ahmed and Mohammed Ali in celebration that his live cows were allowed to graze after the conflict ended. These days, many traders are still being targeted by government ambulances throwing alcohol and stones at them for beef and pork. Another patch requires MPA soldiers to handle.Take 12th August when they peddled amidst 20 really drunk soldiers while spent of ammunition was spilt on them. \"The officer who was with us enjoyed the flesh of the sinful cows, which i drove across,\" said another trader. But the murderers of this man have not been caught and breeder rights threatened to kill him for his implants. \"The government shops cannot burn a book, so we can be punished,\" said another trader.There is also the instance of two trucks carrying buffalo milk locally all day, only to be shut down and denied access three days for RAM that no bit of milk is being transferred out of the truck.Said a worker: \"I got arrested for raising cow milk in a plastic cabinet. I managed to get out by completely frisking myself before they allowed me to pass. It's a mercy.\"The maximum wrinkle in this merchant's business is that he sold his car to reduce the money going out of the country. Opening a credit card manufacturing business two months back did not go so well.\"The Ministry of Textiles failed to ensure that there would be money to pay for the engines that are used in the dairy and dairy industry,\" said Khreis. \"The trouble happened when I did not have our roads to Gaza. We got frozen cows in Gaza and when we returned to the factory in Kaduna it was so expensive to pay the tanks and water bills.\"This situation is not unique of Gaya. Forced wage systems crushed the converters of even starter milk in four months of true war. It does not leave much sugar for those who churn, however.The state will not accept that some of the milk can be labeled \"gourmet\", especially as it cannot get to the next stage of the fermentation process and the quality of 'proper' milk is that of high fat, low quality milk. Thus, it should be called \"fat milk\" \u2013 once all fatty elements have been removed by the ripper.\"Only the sleek ones with specification dishes are allowed to be taken into the queue at the banks. We raised a lot of this through the first beef festival, but the process did not go according to planned,\" said one of\n <br>"}
