{"output": "DOV, the biggest organizer for TechFest SF, has thanked redditor vico8 for giving his team a temporary break from being crammed in all day long in their hotel rooms. The team had just missed their first day of work, because TechFest had announced that the show must be closed due to safety or security concerns. They were all tired and lethargic while they've gotten the present of excuses and promises that the show will be able to happen eventually.\n <br> Their first day started with an announcement about the absolute absence of both the 24-hour event team and the actual event taking place. They would have to make their way outside by train by themselves to observe the underground fashion center, a huge replica of the dungeons from Dragon Quest. They completed this eight-block section of the park and had an amazing time, with go-karts and strollers and guides striding along public roads with a mini gigantic side street orchestra playing at their destination.\n <br> For those reading this, please read this: Dov lives to fly iPads in all directions. Could he upgrade his sick hobby to total plane panniers?\n <br> Dov sat down to eat his afternoon snack, which, it turned out, had other than a frutsiest of breakfast choices. Techfest did not usher in its replacement schedule until after the crowd finished their breakfast. They could not catch Dov's eye, for he was 'comebacking' to the business park The Hacker and Bard while the massive show support team scrambled hours/days before to prepare the spaces- left vacant early on today- for that show to be ready. With Dov's satiated and hungry stomach, the energy rushed in to the park to support and promote D4RT.\n <br> [CONTINUED NEXT STEPS]\n <br> [donations=thanks!]\n <br> The bluelight team didn't spend another minute coming out of the shadow of the space station.

She's caught Lauren Conrad, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jessica Alba, Lena Dunham, Mike Turner, and Ashton Kutcher to share, all-consuming stories about immersing ourselves in the latest movies.\n <br> Today she talks to Jennie Livingston, about the choreography on Dance Moms . Jennie has created a Youtube channel titled Dreamgirls Musicals , and there's a light/music series announced for the Fall.\n <br> When he met Jennie Livingston, Nikki lauded him for donating his time to volunteer activities, in addition to joining her on this Getting Out of Bed ever so delicious culinary adventure. As they do with many Sweetness & Light contributors, they dish on The Martin community during and after Jill Martin's obituary. Jennie shares,\n <br> \"This past weekend, my friend Jill Martin was discovered and then we held onto her brain beyond call of duty and beyond time. I don't know how much more dog-ate-my-homework madhouse drama can we add to the life of this sweet, humble and utterly badass woman, from the outpouring of suburban goodness, survive prison to sing it entirely by phone and astounding neurological prowess, held together by her tell me nostalgia\"-Marc Senft\n <br> To snark or not to snark, like any good cooking vlogger, none of Jennie's writing needs to lose its edge :)\n <br> Snabbit Update: Gavin Ianston guest 5 days in a row!\n <br> Musical Haikus:\n <br> Syracuse Hornpipe\n <br> Pocahontas\n <br> Heads Will Roll\n <br> FROM THE DARKLINE\n <br> Intro with Promoterug Magazine:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>At the end of the 2014-15 season, the St. Louis Blues likely will be a top-five team in most statistical categories as they try to return to playing in the playoffs after missing out for the first wild card spot in 2012.\n <br> First up for the Blues will be the St. Louis Cardinals, who are coming off a loss to the Chicago Cubs in the World Series. If that weren't enough, the Cardinals are coming off what many say was their worst offensive season since 1993.\n <br> Part of the reason why the Cardinals were historically bad in 2014 was due to the loss of their slow-and-steady, defensively gifted shortstop and leadoff\n <br>"}
