{"output": "Nintendo will reveal at E3 2017 the console hybrids it'll be releasing in March, the Nintendo Switch and the Wii U. Both systems use the same hardware, are plugged in to the screen, and the same input. It's unclear if either will work with current-gen consoles, assuming neither console will support the upcoming home streaming technology that uncouples games from their install bases.\n <br> The original Switch it \u2013 The Switch is the successor to the current 3DS. Nintendo made the redesign of the system in 2015, reuniting Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan producer Hiroshi Imanishi as the hardware designer. The game's system specifications haven't changed, but the industrial design as a whole has, and Nintendo even went as far as developing a group designed by industrial design experts to work on the Switch's aesthetic. This time around the games will be designed to work with the system, with Imanishi and company's input in mind.\n <br> As has been previously reported, the Switch will support both traditional controllers that plug into the back of the device and add an extra screen. It has also been confirmed that the system will be backwards-compatible with Wii U games, and that the Switch will be backwards compatible with 3DS as well.\n <br> IGN sources tell us that the Wii U will not make an appearance at E3 but Nintendo may reveal it later this week in an interview with Electronic Entertainment Expo. Wii U founder Satoru Iwata died earlier this year, but Iwata will be honored with a video game industry award in Nintendo's annual shareholders meeting on September 2nd.\n <br> The Wii U market share has been declining since it released the Wii U, but it could have had the biggest impact until its successor came along. Recently a representative for Nintendo stated that \"Wii U users in Europe and Asia released more than a million games in 2016, and according to NPD data had the highest combined unit and download growth for any console that year.\" So it makes sense they could make a play for the console at this year's E3 Show.\n <br> Sources: Axiz, The Verge<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>From Zero Wiki\n <br> Behavior analysis is one of only a few fields of study in academia. Literally thought of as behavior modification, behavioral science in general is an attempt to model behaviors based on what's already understood throughout human history and culture. Behavior would be critical in finding solutions to problems in our society, including career paths and investing in new initiatives. Your career is at stake. Your future is at stake. -- Brian Talbot, Ph.D., Co-founder and Director of XMO\n <br> Wikipedia's behavior page.\n <br> What is behavior? Behavior is the fundamental sequence of actions that a computer program does to achieve a desired end. Programs often fall under the broad rubric of autonomous agents, which include many types of machines that complete a series of defined action tasks or behave in ways that closely resemble real-world interactions. Such entities are often categorized by their basic feelings, motives, and goals (called goals, goals, or goals) towards the world and particular employees or machines (a machine factor or controller).\n <br> Why Study Behavior?\n <br> Many curiosity-driven (in social science), startup-oriented, humanitarian, or science-related campaigns seek to change the world by finding quick findings about what causes your students, clients, or peers to behave positively. For several reasons, academics, programmers, and engineers all expect to learn what biases, assumptions, concerns, off-the-wallhacks, and common misperceptions are prevalent in human system behavior. Additionally, behavior analysis is a mature and scientifically designed field that covers theories, algorithms, and systematic design points to address the intersection of econometrics with medical treatment optimization, data and statistical interpretation, and related business and IT issues. Some of above topics include:\n <br> The complexity of behavioral systems is due to a huge range of different behaviors generated by different elements within such systems and then compounded outside the boundaries of the system (entanglement). The combination of the single behaviors of the system produces a complex chaos of ill-defined behavior available for explication.\n <br> Behavior research can provide an effective bridge connecting systems modeling and mental health applications because it addresses the links between internal and external factors. For each system, there is likely a collection of internal factors, inner decisions, and many external influences.\n <br> Behavior research makes sound scientific sense and can provide evidence that will yield an insight into behavior. Additionally, it is compelling, practical and fun on a broad range of subjects.\n <br> \"Inspiration is from without, plan is from within.
