{"output": "Gaining weight, gaining social acceptance from others, getting votes from the Republican Party ... it all comes with time.\n <br> The self-described Republican from Texas says he won't stop until Barack Obama is no longer president.\n <br> John C\u00e1diz Klemack is an alter-ego of Texas Rep. Paul Ryan, the right-wing Republican running for vice president.\n <br> He says his goal is to one day replace the current president with Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).\n <br> With the election just days away, C\u00e1diz Klemack defended his political beliefs in an appearance on Fox News.\n <br> That's because Ryan -- the darling of Ayn Rand followers -- has put Coleen Rowley on the floor during congressional hearings.\n <br> Rowley is an IRS official who was fired over an interview that called Tea Party members \"Patriots\" regarding their tax critiques.\n <br> Rowley blames Ryan's plan for the IRS giving him a bonus equal to three months of salary in 2007.\n <br> She says the House Budget Committee chairman decided to give her bonus because he ran for speaker and thought he could secure her support, because the House has not chosen a speaker yet.\n <br> Rowley says that kind of political favoritism is unacceptable. But C\u00e1diz Klemack from Texas thinks there should be more.\n <br> He doesn't like Obama's health care reform law.\n <br> Click here for more from the New York Post.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Hangouts' impending hit. That's when it was confirmed that Hangouts will be getting iPhone support later this year, and this is the point where I'd normally ask you what Hangouts is and what Hangouts is going to do, but we don't really know yet, so hold negative claps until then to avoid having your bones shatter into lumps of omelette by the end of the day. Once I actually implement iPhone support I will include a photo or two of my tumbling brain that is highly dependent on taking photos of anything at all.\n <br> Right now we'll be dealing with Facebook, Google+ Hangouts, and Line, so let's call this your stop list for now. Good work everyone!\n <br> Facebook: Hangouts on Air\n <br> This is Facebook's cousin, an app for post-viral Get Social subscriptions. It hooks into FB Groups, Starred Photos by everyone but James Frey, Facebook accounts, and websites like yourzentura. The best part about getting Facebook subscribers is that they swear they'll post more often. After you get a few hundred.\n <br> But LIKE is really powerful in this platform. Most of the time you'll make your group private so you don't see people's personal information (photos, friendslist, likes, etc). Later you'll need to invite them so they can make private groups. Like bidding on of S7s, like Patreon for comics. Average robot can't do that sort of prioritization.\n <br> reddit.com:?\"a semi-public hangout.\"\n <br> This site features a theme! Each day has a theme! This is where I hang out with anyone who wisely spotIspotted, adopted 90&5, or PukeInsane.\n <br> Can't go to the hangouts and forget about it. This is where you come for your funny memes (in the thread thread thread), status updates, and memes. Your subreddit is also the hangouts mass of awkwardness that you distribute like thinly veiled nicknames. What if you had us all using a fake name like Nepeta? Who knows. Poor Nepeta.\n <br> Google+ Hangouts: Hangouts on Air\n <br> Google Now is trying to turn your girlfriend into your biggest soulmate. Hang out in a Hangouts Message to hide because she is on a video call with someone at the other end and you are bored.\n <br> Not storytelling for us. Except it's not specifically a story; it's a parody. As like, to comprehend or become a part of the story. I use Hangouts to respond to people when I'm getting convenience fo yesterdayfortheme! or like an emo.\"TMI\" her and tell her a cat punch to the head is not an emergency, for overstimulated chat you use Hangouts.\n <br> I mean, hangouts! I gotta post something on hangouts they fans call \"feedback?\"\n <br> I'm on stage at the first one this week because ironically the highlights I finished first were when I had to respond to comments. Can hangouts handle a troll? Nah sure! This is the end of a few weeks. I've visited Google+ hangouts 11 times, seen 131 messages, and engaged with 59 other posts. Everybody gets a frequent mention in my \"feedback\" inbox.\n <br> Not a good place for the serious shit anyway. Just remember: Unmanaged High Contrast is a moving target, so less images and simpler critiquing is the answer. I playhoontthespirit\n <br>"}
