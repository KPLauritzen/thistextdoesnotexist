Com. Court by the Justice Department, accusing three separate police officers of excessive force.\n <br> Martin's grandmother was heard coughing as Martin held his head and tried to breathe while the officers held him down.\n <br> null\n <br> \"It happened so quickly and it had such a devastating effect on my grandboney, first my kids are four and my husband is so affected by this that we have never experienced anything like this,\" Collier said.\n <br> Witnesses say some officers stopped Martin on the way home from school and put him in a chokehold in an attempt to ensure his cooperation with their investigation.\n <br> The witnesses tried to stop the police, who used their Tasers against the girls.\n <br> In the complaint, then-Chief Mike Brown denied that the choke hold was justified.\n <br> \"He was motionless when arrested in a choke hold for 30 seconds, for resisting and not believing his life was in danger.\"\n <br> Once the device was removed, a large amount of Martin's body appeared to pass back through his neck and he was declared dead at the scene.\n <br> What might an 8-year-old see when he's battling for his life was made clear by CBS News San Francisco:\n <br> \"The officers had him face down and were trying to get him to breathe,\" said Slomczynski. \"It looked like there was no pulse to him whatsoever.\" \"\u2026 I can put my hand on your throat, I can put my hand on your throat. It's OK. It's not going to hurt you. So, when he was moving he was just kind of protesting. I have precious children. I didn't do this because he was tough or whatever.\" (Calvin Crlago at the 14:15 mark)\n <br> The Fresno County coroner ruled that Martin Carrillo died after having suffered blunt head trauma. A broken leg was also attributed to the beating.\n <br> In order for the tiny body of Martin to exactly match those parameters, he would have had to endured at least 20 head injuries.\n <br> One officer, Sergio Tijerina, is now being charged in addition to his partner's automatic termination prior to any any inquiry.\n <br> According to Fresno's Human Relations Commission documents, one officer, Tijerina, has two prior complaints between 2008 and 2013 for excessive force.\n <br> {Support Police State USA }\n <br> Accountability Check\n <br> Three Fresno County.
