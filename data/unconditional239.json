{"output": "The Democratic National Convention is in full swing -- and it looks like Hillary Clinton supporters are going to enjoy a bit of a vacation right in Las Vegas.\n <br> In many ways, the revolution the Brooklyn-born politician set in motion in this city 9,000 miles from her New York home is just one place to look for Clinton's on-the-ground roots after she officially sewed up her nomination from delegates at the happiest, most dramatic finish in American history.\n <br> An the convention's various \"roles and responsibilities\" claims have already begun and will continue throughout the week, but Clinton's state visits are another way for campaign workers to get in the friendly spirit of the town whose name she has symbolized since setting foot here in 1969 to run for U.S. Senate against Edward Kennedy.\n <br> Clinton, of course, won -- setting aside a range of initial official challengers.\n <br> She said at the convention that her first choice was to live in Vermont, a tiny New England state with about 7,000 people that boasted notoriously strict gun laws. When not in Vermont, the celebrated vintner could be found -- since the 1980s -- at the bottom of a barn or a fire escape. Clinton has spent good part of her life in holes in the ground.\n <br> \"I grew up in a small town in very small country. The people we took to independence were, to a man and a woman, farmers,\" Clinton said. \"If you had to vote today for the president from among the small town folks who loved frozen yogurt and girl scouts, I think you know where I come back.\"\n <br> A majority of U.S. residents supported Clinton in her 2008 presidential bid -- mostly rural, ethnically diverse rural areas of Iowa and southern New Hampshire.\n <br> In 2012, a Republican candidate for the first time appeared to come close to winning a majority of rural voters -- 41 percent. That won by a margin of 13 points, but it was no drunken stumble that cost Mitt Romney entire states in the Rust Belt.\n <br> What changed was Clinton's rightward turn as a result of husband Bill's scandals -- and the sharp swing of the Affordable Care Act that brought tens of millions of people into the fold of private health insurance.\n <br> In the process, Obama gave the state to Republicans and locked up laughably vast swing states in 50 populous states, illustrated in raw numbers however with the totals and depth of country we've come to.\n <br> \"I think they voted for (Republicans) because it's the lesser of two evils,\" said Greg Benzing, 82, of the small New York town of Carpentersville. \"I think if they had to live with Hillary, they would certainly vote for Hillary.\"\n <br> Two other Clinton 'roles' as convention recounts, candidate preferences and breaking down the convention into \"officeholder\" and \"state\" levels provide bits of history. Whether or not President Barack Obama goes for Clinton is a direct choice for Democratic voters, given that voters have pointed to his policies -- and which is easier to recall gave a good chuckle at the convention.\n <br> \"I want the job you got today. I don't want your president\" \u2013 @realDonaldTrump\n <br> The Democratic convention is getting well-traveled -- but key roles like bedside visits designed to get into the homes of Clinton's wants are not expected beyond Thursday. Used plane tickets are also among the ways campaign workers make friends in vacant hotel rooms across the city and state of Nevada, and there's even a Snapchat account for Bernie.\n <br> Delia in Atlantic City, \"Mary\" in Charleston, West Virginia \u2013 or if you're lucky, just some random person -- Clinton said this Democratic convention could help Republicans win by showcasing voters who explain why she, an English professor and a former secretary of state, was better than the Republican nominee.\n <br> \"If you want to poll real voters and wipe out half of this entire countryside and vote against working class Republicans,\" Clinton said, \"then you better understand at least some of those voters know who you are.\"\n <br> Then you know who to try to talk to.\n <br> W.
