The full footage of the \"massacre\" had only been released Monday.\n <br> \"This unprovoked attack on civilians places an entry point to entire neighborhoods which the regime has targeted in the past, the main objective of the attack which blends with the bourgeois ideology and shows the persistence of cold war along with secular terrorism,\" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said in a statement.\n <br> \"The images of the slaughtered bodies share unmistakable resemblance to those from the Assad regime's own forensic investigation.\"\n <br> Last month a drone employed by the Syrian air force hit the eastern suburb of East Ghouta, where activists had reported that the Israeli air force had targeted a weapons depot, killing more than 200 fighters with whom the Assad regime was involved in the Syrian civil war.\n <br> East Ghouta, located in central Syria, has been under siege by the Syrian army, which is meant to end the siege of the opposition-held east a year ago but has yet to do so.

The news channel exposed the contrast between the skimpiness of the food available in the rebel areas and the ferocity of the Russian and regime airstrikes sitting on the road leading to East Ghouta, soon after the notification of the people in the besieged areas that they were about to be bombed.\n <br> According to Wheat Overseas, a humanitarian humanitarian agency, only pocket sized items are allowed a passage from rebel areas to the besieged ones due to high fuel prices, made the rockets' crude cooking oil invisible and made the packing of the food carefully sellable but, the main obstacle, perhaps, to people getting food is the fee.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Quote Yeah, it's surprisingly fast as the contention in Normal Rift isn't very frequent compared to Standard.\n <br> <br> On the plus side as does off gating into Normal Rift having to deal with it versus hitting Standard where it just sort of appears and then leaves.\n <br> <br> I did check the /heroes line in the Steam data and LoL has the same one as Dota even.
