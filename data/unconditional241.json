{"output": "HELP US PAY OUR DEBT\n <br> The comments were all a report from a job interview as some people were prepared to offer me the job \u2013 as I could travel with customer insurance.\n <br> There were mixed replies about availability on Saturdays with one of my friends saying there weren't any jobs available which is partly a good thing as I don't like the way I spend hours making home claims and can't work out if my broken front door is because the fox got me or I didn't.\n <br> When I returned home from work feeling quite non-functional, my wife said it was because I hadn't buzzed in for no end of hours and I just needed to get some sleep as a pet was barking loud.\n <br> I slept pretty well last night though, needing just over 3 hours to get feeling back as I come from a week where I demanded 18 hours sleep.\n <br> After a bit of searching the job postings for nice bread crumb weather events I was able to contribute to the launch of the BigPicture section of Facebook. It appears as a bluff effort anonymously with the initial pitch that it would take the place of Twitter as the network for serving cold, uncool, not the available range of social media channels. Anyway this is great promo material they started back there we will see!\n <br> by Inga<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>I'm a rather cheap fellow.\n <br> I've spent several thousand dollars in just one year. Growing up, I didn't think travel was that expensive. Even your basics listed on vacationoesugasso.com? I could go 24 2/3 hours on a nearly 19 hour flight and still have two or three left over for incidental business expenditures, or leisure purchases?\n <br> Coming from a banker background, this isn't an option.\n <br> When you actually have the money to lighten up, and budget properly (read: don't fork over that cash), I began spending.\n <br> Here's a few examples I've studied:\n <br> Ferries to Italy. What does the spending look like? Well that's for another post.\n <br> Europe, \"new\" and that's precisely what this would be. For who knows what the economy will be like 5 years or 10 years from now. But Western Europe, fasce, non?\n <br> A week in the Abruzzi. Guided vacations from babyhood to 18.\n <br> Spain. This costs around 15k a week for tourist activity alone. A lot of it is incidental so I'm not going to get into that.\n <br> Japan. A TWO week trip in spring.\n <br>  South Africa. A WEDDING. With return flights to the US.\n <br> China. A WEEK. A TWO WEEK. A FOREIGN BEEN for two people.\n <br> Peraroche in Brazil. An 8-day stay on which the typical expenditures looks roughly like this: showers, laundry, dinner, accommodations, shopping, guided tours, spa hospital it was just days of birds and access to the beach. Tangna puna\u2026\n <br> Pilsen to Urbana in Champaign, IL. The rent costs around $400 a week to stay. So, 8k and minus expenses per week.\n <br> So, next, let me introduce to the world the Finnish Elderly Traveling Companion. This is called Maaositoma Oy, or \"Government Icons.\" It's an old popular book which consists of illuminating cartoons that pokes fun at officials, and whatnot. I do have two of these tucked away at old habits die hard.\n <br> The comic tells the story of the asIstanna I event in Oulu, Finland, 2005. The Singshuet varaldalaht vartaaalaskes sevantaaalottajumon i blitripilla taalin - which translates into: Obscuring light sounds so as not to lose the scent of fragrance, and as a trail marker to hide this trail . While this sounds pretty corny, the pictures go deep into the surreal and tragedy of elderly elderly carrying on in a way beyond their years. I've make a few mock up designed T-shirts with niches cut out for the illustrations.\n <br> What which makes the book so striking is the juxtaposition with the flattering taste of an older brother.

Gunther has a new piece for Black Book, exploring the question, \"Should those in mourning burn Satanic candles during their family graveside service?\" Gunther declines to say the language to which he subscribes in each instance, citing Biblical analogies, in the hopes of influencing each believer to bite their tongues and pray those prayers to God.\n <br> And\u2026why be motivated by argument, rather than affection, when faced with such a controversial question? Both sides of the debate can find opening lines for their narrative, but it's unlikely you'll find\n <br>"}
