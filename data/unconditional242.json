Its members cannot independently verify claims by rebel groups of officials killed.\n <br> Haddadin was taken after an explosion in the Hawara district of Aleppo province, Itar-Tass news agency reported, without saying which side was responsible.\n <br> The killing happened in villages east of the northern Syrian town of Khan Arnaba and close to the Turkish frontier, Itar-Tass said, adding Haddadin's death was likely an assassination by either rebels or government forces.\n <br> Haddadin had been invited to speak \"most of the time\" at peace talks Assad attended earlier in the year that drew world powers. Canadian officials have not commented but had cautioned ahead of the talks that Assad could careen from crisis to crisis and that Canada can not afford to be a bystander.\n <br> Canada and about six other nations tried to broker a deal last year aimed at persuading Assad to cede power. A Syrian government well-placed source knew of Haddadin's death as it came to light late on Tuesday.\n <br> In his speech at the UN, which focused mostly on migration from Syria, UN chief Ban Ki-moon urged Syria's five-year civil war to end.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Not much before GIMP 2.9 is out.
