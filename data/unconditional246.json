{"output": "The public thought Kobe Bryant failed his chemo treatment in January and he didn't do it on purpose.\n <br> Well, let's get this straight. Kobe signed a buyout clause with the Lakers. Everything. Immediately. In the summer of 2016. Exactly when he was going to spend the third year of his career with the Lakers. Yep.\n <br> Quinder called the buyout, which was $41,985 with a $26,338 salary, \"all about money.\"\n <br> It will definitely be debated -- and brought up -- whether Bryant should have tolerated a third year of whiplash.\n <br> \"I would love to stay with him, to put up pictures of our kids on his trophy case,\" Olohan said. ''It would mean everything to me to see Kobe coming home on those rights.''\n <br> Let's not rule out Olohan is just hoping for a comeback meeting with Kobe, whatever the risk.\n <br> Kobe began his hiatus, clouding the final months of his career, by rolling his ankle against the 76ers. He came off it, played the next night and a half and was scheduled to return to the lineup Friday against the Mavericks.\n <br> Then Miami sent him to the locker room early in the third quarter on the last play of a win over Oklahoma City. It was doubtful he would play Sunday before returning with the Lakers last Saturday against the Hornets.\n <br> \"I thought it came as a shock to everyone,\" Katalin said. \"It could have been avoided.\"\n <br> Kobe admitted it cost him motivation. He missed 18 of the Lakers' last 19 games and, while there were signs something was seriously wrong, he had ample motivation to get the word out about the possible treatments to his blood malignancy.\n <br> \"I want to win, but I also want to give a lot of my energy towards it,'' he said, \"and not show weakness anywhere. It was my responsibility this year.''\n <br> At all levels. Badly. It was much more. It was anything and everything in what was taken care of before going into hibernation. That is not very easy to do, with everything on the line.\n <br> With Odom in the hospital after rupturing his Achilles, it was the opening to allow coach Luke Walton to try out two unproven pieces. Olohan is more experienced than either of them.\n <br> On one hand, he knows how this is never-ending, demands unprecedented sapping, pain and everything else. On the other, this is a \"no, no, no, stinking eventually, stinking please, home 1,000\" trade.\n <br> But the \"no, no, no, stinking please\" part didn't make Odom feel there was anything to make there begin to look past. This was about at least making his body, who was misdiagnosed last year when tests revealed he had had bone marrow cancer that a bone marrow transplant cured, feel better.\n <br> \"Right now, it's good,\" Odom said after sitting out the win over the #Mavs. \"I can't go out there and tell the people that can make the situation better. But right now, I'm feeling better than I ever have in a long time. It was worth it. Absolutely worth it.''\n <br> Then it was back to being Kobe.\n <br> Yosh isn't going to kill Kobe again\n <br> To equivocate in the OBtwins' defense of a teammate, savior, former Laker, although we can say that one time so far this season is something we just can't sit by.\n <br> The Obgoblets have an open back door sentiment (+ Next Regrets Page) as well.\n <br> The alliance of interested 3-point shooters and blockers ever since Jordan Dumars' \"We need to spread the floor\" philosophy.\n <br> Joe, Uthoff and Marcus Morris with Odom in the hospital and then Doc to kick in for a small war chest of timeouts once he returned.\n <br> Dwight Howard, Mike D'Antoni's UCLA Angels of Havoc was in the air before guys had the meetings of being selective in ignoring forwards/wings playing in Olympic break games.\n <br> Al Horford trimmed his saying a series of tweets tug on Morries satisfied desire to legit member of the NBA conversation like you'd find Phil.\n <br> Amare Stoudemire's won a lot of games and T.J. was his orchestrator. Plus, his times.\n <br> Which is why about 1/4 of you can't stop winking.\n <br> New month. Entering May. The standard looking Sixers have received good news the past week when present things that are not necessarily bad that can be progressive, thanks to your Sugar Daddy.\n <br> Rookies Nerlens Noel and Jahlil Okafor get slid over belonged in LLC years.
