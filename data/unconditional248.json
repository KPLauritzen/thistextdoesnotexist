{"output": "SPONSORED\n <br> Washington's leftist media is in that place liberals used to go where all their opponents stopped listening. Their politicians have become increasingly radicalized and too many members the establishment are unlikely to follow them. Then the world goes dark on the left. But this time, the darkness is a bubble.\n <br> \"The left's media network is disjointed and exaggerates the number of its supporters,\" Lawrence Wittner, Randall G. O'Bannon Professor of Media Studies and Ethics at George Washington University, wrote to the Left. \"Their supporters are smaller in number than the conservative media wing, and the establishment journalists whose arguments they cite support them over rivals and hostile elites.\"\n <br> Parts of the left \u2013 like the New York Times \u2013 are lost in an echo chamber. Each newspaper employs a distinctive guide to \"religion,\" learn only a few basics, but never miss the point. Rarely has a respected reporter or analyst predicted with so much confidence that a Democrat would win.\n <br> Herbert Ziegler, Social Media Editor of the New York Times, wrote recently that many Democrats had become too scared. That frightened them, but they didn't know how to negotiate. She then and later in the piece cited Ron Davis, wife of former Baltimore Mayor Martin O'Malley, and others. Meanwhile Mr. Davis was bashing Donald Trump.\n <br> This paper has followed the national Democratic Party for more than a century, inventing \"Bipartisan Pagans\" at every turn and denigrating rivals for bigotry and stupidity.\n <br> Ironically, like its Republican counterparts, the Times may be losing influence and support among its outspoken progressive readers and listeners. Its capitulation on climate change, which led under Mr.wittner to conclude of the left, \"they want in with everyone and are responding to appeal for labor, immigration issues, and race relations, but not to trade policies.\"\n <br> One liberal Washington Post commentator mirrored her paper's attitudes when she opined bluntly in September, \"If you hop off the leader-line, this whole thing is lost.\" And at its height the Times held out as a paragon of all things progressive.\n <br> But in the post-election political landscape it's apparently not that way anymore.\n <br> Like Adam Johnson on Facebook.
