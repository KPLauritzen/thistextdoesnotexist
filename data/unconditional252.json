While it appeared Palmer and Ruiz took their views to the letter, others who were at the rally were blatant in their anti-Dejesus-Reagan stance.\n <br> Dressed in black, with their mouths taped shut, the women appeared calm as they filmed the scene on their cell phones.\n <br> \"The only place where we are left from a progressive majority\" community was \"over sitting on the Board of Directors,\" explained Judy Fitzsimmons on her own non-burgesting cell phone. \"Until, I don't know, they applied ideological filters so we're never allowed to communicate one-on-one after meetings,\" she added.\n <br> Dire.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Vapor is an amazing thing - there's no denying that.
