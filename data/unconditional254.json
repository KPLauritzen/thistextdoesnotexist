{"output": "i don't like to post on this forum\u2026\n <br> but i have just had a very real experience.\n <br> There will be some drop in the climate and some regions are going to be a lot colder. Note these regions are not like the arctic. However this happens. All if they steppe the regions in a stable state. It also happens with climate fluctuations.\n <br> I have been working in an oil company. And even though my job is in the oil industry, i only accept customer's applications for the job once i have completed my staff training. You cannot have jobs if you appear to be a fool.\n <br> It's amazing how no one believes this to be true\u2026\n <br> <br> Two weeks ago I had a Mexican client apply for the job. You may have something like this same client so you can assure yourself of what I say. Obviously, I cannot locate my colleague, think it will be impossible for me to pray. Decision is made, they arrive for the interview. They cook a sample that is used for the telephone interview.\n <br> After the telephone interview couple drops by the office. I have dinner with my wife and my co-worker visits. I gave my Mexican colleague an assigned photo, take my picture. And then I give him a ID card with his passport and other ID to accompany with the card. I should note much of the Mexican \"Sunset Policy\" is very loose on compliance. By this marriage most of the Mexican girls want \"equity\". It is ok to go home with a couple of hundred thousand, give them services, have sex with the few or a few thousand. In other words starting by something big, keep the string going. They pay for the next step, be they multimillion alone or have access to millions of dollars.\n <br> Anyway in case of Mexican client, my humble advice has always been, do not let it happen.\n <br> And this Mexican client will never do that. I found out he works fulltime at a cybercaf\u00e9 job where with vacations he goes on living off the objective system. Further, he is never on the clock. So when he gets fully paid off he will live off this money. What is he doing in a restaurant? There is nothing for him to do. Marriage to girlfriend must have brought a lot of changes. In the period when I was with this student, the mathematician his wife would come to work in the home facilities department. Interestingly she paid more attention to him than the guy taking care of his look.\n <br> I don't have evidence he did anything bad, but I do feel this little experience has made him wiser. She's not with him anymore, but she's not exactly my ideal_woman either.\n <br> In the course of two and a half years, this entire enterprise went down by one, business model, and the intention of a company to run as a highly marketing wide circle moving to become what I would call, benevolent dictator. What I can see at least one million family is extremely disturbed by there career change and the decisions by their different group managers. These guys know don't have the antennas to see the bull market crash into grid anyway.\n <br> FOTM(fugitive oilman) She wanted to become a top casino. Alltogether, goodbye people \ud83d\ude42\n <br> These people run their nest, and then they lose it. The exit window is just too much for them to bear.\n <br> When handing over the global leadership councils of all national oil companies, the rubes act like they don't even recognize. Anyway, if anyone tries to know any more about the motives of CEOs, simply mention Citigroup (former Humble Oiler) big NY bond holders.\n <br> Brain (who am i kidding) sells for 10% of market cap \u2013 but since they add value in the lower price range. Apparently *** proceedings are OKIn case of the retiree & layoff process\u2026 If you buy the energy products on cash, after exodus has happened, you can apply for payments on a different note\u2026.but be patient, it takes about 5\u20137 days.***<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>This July, Aurora Cannabis announced that they were partnering with a small Canadian medical cannabis producer to bring pure cannabis to the nation's physicians. It was also announced that CannaRoyalty (a Canadian holding company) would own over a 32% stake in each of the company's Fin Hogs brand operations. Today, investors can get a look at some financials, stakeholder presentation, and more.\n <br> AMD:\n <br> The company began shipping two cannabis oils through its Aurora Aurora Genetics subsidiary just this month. Aurora Genetics is the subsidiary that produced the Canadian cannabis oils except for the Aurora Dry brand which is the company's premium brand of cannabis oils. Right now, once you've purchased their product, moving forward you will have access to high CBD cannabis oil products. Products will depend on the various grades of cannabinoids the company comes up with in the future.\n <br> Interesting things about the AMD financial:\n <br> The company is\n <br>"}
