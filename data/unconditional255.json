{"output": "Although Second Cup Bourbon Whisky has been around the flavored bourbon sphere for some time, they also permit guests to purchase it.\u00a0 Rumor has it they served the first bottle (see photos below) on January 1st, 2009 and they have only been public since then in an out of production form.\u00a0 I believe these are potentially their salesibles and I haven't seen much since.\u00a0 My e-mail (Shannon Fine) says they also do \"statement bottling.\"\u00a0 However, I would like to see a bottle if this was true - if it was an out of production product, I fully expect it would look like this .\u00a0 Just showing a reminder for my fellow cognoscenti in regards to their products - they would not sell me a sample simply to see what it tasted like.\n Anyway, the very first Second Cup Bourbon Whiskey I tried was the 30 year old.\u00a0 While I have enjoyed Four Roses' limited edition releases and other house made bourbons such as Ancient Age and Bushman's, my absolute favorite favorite Bourbons to keep my whiskies in my collection are the large production Single Malts.\u00a0 So it was of special interest to see how well the 30 year young bourbon handled the pairing with heat.\u00a0 As said before, I believe this to be the first time I have ever done a pairing of an 80 proof bourbon with heat!\u00a0 On cask conditioning, I think this pairing went very well... Let's start with the...\n Coincidentally, there was actually a Seagram's Label Ten on the shelves during Tennessee Honey\u00a0 Tour & Benefit on the morning I wanted the cask.\u00a0 Not only did I know the co-host of the event was a big whiskey enthusiast, I also recognized the label and notes.\u00a0 Wonderful!\u00a0 I don't recall Seagram directly made a bourbon for Seagram's so I was so pleased to see our brands collide!\u00a0 Oops. :) \u00a0Well, I thought to myself \"Why not savor this while the texture settles out.\u00a0 When this first arrived it was lightly carbonated. I can't remember how much it went back and forth between light carbonation and wet weight.\u00a0 This allows it to hold the flavor and floral notes that I've always been craving.\u00a0 As expected, the heat helped the expressiveness in the Bourbon & Heat Texture. As it settled into the barrel, the flavors began to fade a bit.\u00a0 In fact, the heat actually diluted some of the nuance that the coolest part of this debut initially brought on.\u00a0 Instead, the flavours settled into Creme Brulee, Sugared Cherries, Cherries Grits, Pineapple Upside-Down Cake, Fleur de Sel, Lemon Meringue Pie, and Grapefruit Squash.\u00a0 Because the liquid was really chilled, this stuff was as smooth and clean as this dessert should be.\u00a0 The grapefruity flavor really takes a backseat to the other notes but I would be a liar if I said they didn't add a whole lot to it.\u00a0 I think this could become a very good and well-balanced Creme Brulee-eater. So, the unwounded alcohol was the slow mingling, the simplistic sweetness, the heat, and the 23 year thick toffee.\u00a0 While I did enjoy this an amazing treat, as always, I might have to vary what I'm consuming in the future. Its quality isn't too special, but the bulk of the taste reminds me of an dessert with some large decadently sweet items thrown in to give it another dimension.\u00a0 I would also retest again if someone would be kind enough to let me. Thank you Shannon Fine for tipping me to the performer and also to everyone you said made this bonding experience even more enjoyable.

Utilising 12 sociologists at 63 UK universities and extolling the aspects of narratives that have grabbed the world's attention - from Star Wars to Beyonce and from all over the sea to Bohemian Rhapsody - he reveals the step-by-step steps of the confidence narrative and the consequences of being caught out.\n <br> Looking at the impact of our images on public understanding of social issues and judgments, Bauman is keen to tackle the difficult question of how we project our belief systems, which carries political consequences across societies.
