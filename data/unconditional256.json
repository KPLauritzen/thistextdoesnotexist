Lorenz said police received multiple calls to the Hilltop Foothills Mobile Home Park, concerned about shots fired there. Video from the scene shows a gunman claiming he was attacked, who is then seen firing several shots at his sides. Lorenz said a major concern in this case was getting a good description of the gunman, so an officer trained in other situations shot eight time at the suspect's back to help triangulate that location.\n <br> <br> Troopers said the man wearing an Anderson safety helmet was taken to Large General and is facing the possibility of life-threatening injuries.\n <br> <br> More than 30 people were inside the park when the shots rang out after 1 a.m., Lorenz said. They only found out about a third who had been shot after they entered and discovered others with gunshot wounds nearby, Lorenz added.\n <br> <br> Troopers are searching the area with bloodhounds and they believe the suspect may still be in the mobile home park and that he may come out to confront those who came to check on the wake in the parking area of their park.\n <br> <br> Anyone with information about the shooting was asked to call New Mexico State Police Detectives at 505-723-5652.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The brave woman is at very large odds with the country.\n <br> <br> But can she find some help, after the violence?\n <br> The Dutch citizens received very different answers upon hearing the same question.
