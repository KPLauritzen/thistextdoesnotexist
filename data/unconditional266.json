{"output": "Tens of thousands of Palestinians rallied Sunday in a show of opposition to Israel's confrontation with the Palestinians over security coordination, as the Palestinian Authority leader said Israel had no right to attack Gaza under any respect of international law.\n <br> As clashes continued following the killing of a Palestinian in a suspected Israeli abduction it offered to 'mitigate' the threat.\"The government has told us today that Israeli forces are informed of the intention to attack after strong pressure from the United States and other countries,\" Yasser Abed Rabbo informed the crowd . \"In case they execute in Gaza, the PA will assuredly find a way to prevent the calamity.\"\n <br> Al Jazeera said that the demonstration was \"part of a wider campaign to show opposition to Egyptian military action against Hamas in the Sinai peninsula\", and said that it was \"one of the largest demonstrations in Palestine to date\".\n <br> Barack Obama has said the United States disapproves of the Egyptian action but warned that the possibility remains that the Hamas-backed government of Hamas could not be restored immediately.\n <br> \"There are differences of opinion within the administration,\" he told ABC News. \"And we are watching closely to see if the Egyptians can put together a situation where they can have a peaceful transition of power, are effective at bringing an end to this conflict, and move on to containing violence in Sinai.\"\n <br> Israel's prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu warned that \"like every Israel is affected after a terrorist attack\" on its soil. \"There will be a cost for embarking on such military activities - a cost even higher than the victims themselves.\"\n <br> Forensic Pathologist's report claims slain Hamas member was subjected to repeated live fire\n <br> Al Jazeera reported that two Israeli tanks were involved in the naval clashes in the early hours of Sunday, after being sent from a southerly position to Cairo and lured back towards the surface ship by phantoms of Egyptian ships.\n <br> Egypt's military government has imposed a state of emergency after a barrage of rockets were launched from across the strip on northern cities, including Tel Aviv. The Ministry of Interior is waging a diplomatic offensive in its effort to limit the violence to restricted areas, while the international community supplies supplies and radios to the Gaza Strip on a daily basis.\n <br> UN peacekeepers for the last ten days have been stationed in southern Gaza. One said Sunday that he had withdrawn from the southern area in light of shelling.\n <br> Mordechai Vanunu, was one of the six men abducted by the terrorist group, the Irgun Zvai Leumi Brigade, in August 1979 as they transported boxes of highly enriched uranium from France to a nuclear plant in Romania. The six believed to have been killed were returned in 1981 But the two who were released in 1990 have since become vocal supporters for the state of Israel. Although the situation in Gaza allegedly has shifted dramatically since 2014 when a truce agreement between Israel and Hamas was signed, the dead body of Nachshon Raphaelson, a division chief in the Irgun Zvai Leumi Brigade and founder of the Memories of God group is a reminder that, for Israelis as well as Palestinians, life remains temporary.\n <br> The Haaretz daily reported that the Obama administration told Israel to disarm Hamas when in 2008, a new Hamas regime replaced the other state based in Gaza, before the summer's Operation Cast Lead failed. Speaking in his recent interview for Al-Jazeera's 'The Stream', Hamas' official imprisoned weapons procurement vessel, the Mavi Marmara, also said that \"Who remembers nine tons of explosives, 29 boats, 389 passengers and crew being smuggled through Israel [threatening] 80 willies?\" Dr Paavo Meimaaiya, who officially placed the responsibility for Operation Protective Edge at Abbas' door, told Ma'an that \"this time the reason given for the operation is that Egypt 'justifies' it, without giving any explanation of international law.\" \"There is a political nature to the operation, without clear evidence, it is known as the 'hot on the heels operation',\" he added.\n <br> Growing nationalism in Gaza does not deny the need for robust response and selective attacks\n <br> According to a free newspaper, Palestinians have reacted to the attack on Their20 by walking in a ring around a corner to an undisclosed location, securing neighboring shop-keepers and firing shots into the night through the windows.\n <br> The U.N. agency only provides Palestinians with five hours of electricity per day and daily requests to replace supplies with diesel are denied. Fresh water and sanitation are unavailable, leaving many households ill-equipped to ensure their own survival. Although wealthy families have their medical facilities in Palestine, the Samaritan Fund has given only emergency assistance to 700 families. Not only is the situation dire in Gaza's impoverished enclave, the Syrian-Palestinians who live with the intermingling and constantly contentious nature of their place of birth get hardly any support.\n <br> Reuters reported that the USAID, which is assisting Palestinians, has \"set up a special humanitarian response committee to coordinate aid in\n <br>"}
