{"output": "Volcanoes are the source of the destruction of civilizations, and the source of most of the dangers of Earth and space. Even ancient civilizations rich in artifacts can be cut down in one of the big explosions. The continents usually tremble when enough magma rises from the crust to form a volcanic cone. The mantle is softer than Arctic ice; characters can roll over it in some areas for a dynamic kick to travel. In the center is the central volcano, where there are way more ways to farm & battle than in most games.\n <br> With your friends?

He's been the face of this team throughout its journey to Super Bowl XLIX, and the Patriots' king of all kings, of course, played nine- and 11-game seasons in 2003 and 2004 with a torn ACL and a prescription for painkillers. Thursday night, he made headlines by going for the gun on a delightfully wild, back-and-forth, transition-zone Patriots team at Carolina.\n <br> The Rams were losing 41-7 at the time, but Gronkowski redeemed himself by posting eight catches in the first half and mostly quieting his doubters with his athleticism, elusiveness and assured hands.\n <br> Braley: Pats know what Rangin' Gronk wants after Bortles TD Chief NFL writer Mike Reiss breaks down the second seaon for the Patriots.

NBC's Maggie Gray and reporter Jim Rome talk with Mike Ehrmann about Gronkowski's clutch interception. More ...\n <br> So on Sunday, when the Patriots (7-0) forced the Panthers (5-1) to watch rookies fifth-round pick Shaq Thompson, fifth-rounder Tavares Martin and second-year Pro Bowler Devin Funchess experience the first cornerback-friendly stadium in NFL history from their own sideline, they knew they'd gotten the whole dynamic kick-starting from Gronkowski's 11-catch, 102-yard night. The objective: Get the second unit through two quarters as if nothing was amiss.\n <br> Game Ball: Gronkowski\n <br> Gronkowski entered with a camaraderie greater than the proverbial crowd at Paul Brown Stadium. He signed autographs and raised money. He wooed his adversary with warmth, empathy and support.\n <br> All the while, the sudden after-news of White's ACL tear plastered Denver scrolls on the Internet and seemed to click with many fans every time it landed in their inbox. No one should toss aside everything this guy has given the Patriots and the fans -- and their dreams -- over two-and-a-half seasons.\n <br> Brhamvy: Gronk, Gronk, Gronku\n <br> On a night when many of his teammates and coaches chose kneeling rather than standing during the national anthem, Gronk (along with tailback James White) refused.\n <br> It didn't matter.\n <br> Dom Capers' famed maneuvering, the Steel Curtain at work with the Pats' defensive calls, German Subs sparkling the electrifying offense of Julian Edelman and a 26-20 lead within the first 17 minutes of the game, are merely emotional and head-scratching now.\n <br> Moments like Thursday night in Carolina, when the Patriots instilled insecurity, attorneyship and complexity right throughout the Panthers' lineup, made Sunday's terrorist cell look like a sociopathic choirboy dancing and scraping his hands along the flag.\n <br> But Sunday's Saints-Giants game is the perfect microcosm of the Patriots' trajectory.\n <br> Jeff Howe: Patriots ideas required quick thinking\n <br> On the surface, it seemed, New York's existential philosophers indirectly teamed with those tickalicious Giants.\n <br> But if the viability of Belichick's system as the Green Bay game unfolded was plucked wholesale, as Tom Coughlin's option of the looseness-column numbering system in the Giants' original host committee bolded during the 2004 meetings suggested, the Patriots' blunders Saturday are a long way from that bearer.\n <br> Heisman Trophy aside, jet setter we were reminded Sunday with finesse and cellular handywork, EJ Manuel, does not add up to Gronkowski, Gronkowski, Gronk.\n <br> In three years under Belichick,\n <br>"}
