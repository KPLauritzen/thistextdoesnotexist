According to general sociological theories, males and females have different interests in interaction and stimulation during childhood and adolescence but will adjust accordingly when making their real life decisions. The current results show that males are more often receptive to prepubescent and adolescent communication about sex, reproductive role in future life and skepticism about their own genitaliating potential while females differ in behavior and preference when it comes to erotically stimulating activities or psychological stress than male behavior. Moreover, the sample of adolescents, mostly girls, does not present vibra- remains at enormous cost to them as a pee-ter (sociological processes seem to be different for males and females). The results show that more males tend to experience sexual arousal after being therefter sexually stimulating; and this may be a result of pressure by male peers especially since reading socio-relationship and perceived biological differences in the genitalia make this signal to the adolescents \"we are different, enjoy alone\". On the other hand, girls are not just of equal or greater interest in other Males during their daily phases of pychogenesis, orgasm, and after sexual contact than males, but males are more nervous than women in future years and males are more selfish than women (however it cannot be observed in studies on the influence of sexual relations, perceived predisordern, masturbating, sexual contact etc.). Moreover, the results show that masturbation to fantasy and general pornography are more prevalent in males, and most sub-groups are overwhelmingly mobilized to this alternative adult-based masturbation than the normal mentalway for youth.\n <br> \u00bb Introduction\n <br> \u00ab Clinical and public health importance of the question \u00abDoes masturbation harm me directly?\" Included to this balancing question are direct physical health consequences, such as cancer, and more indirect biochemical, psychological, social, religious and unconscious difficulties resulting from organisms who cannot separate their appearance from their internal underground serving processes. Therefore, post-childhood masturbation is the key to catch the nutslock of similar childhood anxiety developing in adulthood.
