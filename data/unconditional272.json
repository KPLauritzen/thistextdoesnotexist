As you can tell by looking at the Sephatri of each (and who came first, the Solar or Lunar Tarot?), there were originally more than ten cards before they added Draculas and Lone King.\n <br> Now I'd already tried refining this basic structure, but experienced some issues (see below).\n <br> The solution was to bring the physical manifestations a dozen at a time, and then a dozen or so more once I settled on the exact card you see before you. After that, I just built in slots for cards as things happened in my life involving medical emergencies, hepatitis and similar diseases, ). 1985 changed parties YET AGAIN and ... It's just too confusing to deal with! So where else can I find inspiration for a Dark Tarot deck?\n <br> See everyone's favorite women (and what a good fit!) in 11 Picks from Hell.\n <br> Perhaps Shirley Jackson didn't know her tokens of intellectual vehicle don't exist in his painting originally.
