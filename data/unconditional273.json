(WTVR)-- Many Interscholastic League coaches are struggling to find a graduation rate boost in the new tougher sanctioning rules. Recently there's been talk of Virginia Tech facing a graduation problem.\n <br> Many parents and students once again took to social media to share concerns about the lack of progress, and the shakeup.\n <br> Virginia Tech has a graduation rate of 82.2 percent. Top-ranked Virginia is just ahead of Elon and Virginia colonial college currently have grad rates of 81 and 78 percent, respectively.\n <br> Tonya Moore-Gestell posted video on Facebook showing a conversation with a college guidance counselor.\n <br> \"There's no turnaround's, there's no nothing,\" said counselor Bellum Jennings.\n <br> Jennings is the vice president of Academic Services and Educational Leadership for Interscholastic League LLC, the governing body for Virginia's high school athletic programs.\n <br> Not only has Jennings annoyed many parents who believe lackluster graduation rates are raising questions about leadership, she's also here to answer them.\n <br> \"Our job is to keep performance high. I don't believe that schools really understand what's expected of them. It's not fair next year will end up with the same people graduating as the year before,\" Jennings said.\n <br> Jennings says the questions come not only from parents but also student athletes whose grades were under dip last year.\n <br> Ann Gillespie, a mother of an athletics kid, said the possible graduation rate changes have worried parents.\n <br> \"For the next five years it means no pass or fail,\" Gillespie said.\n <br> So far those concerns seem to be unfounded. School officials tell NewsChannel 3 that even with tougher standards Facebook groups still say that Virginia Tech is essentially falling short of 85 percent.\n <br> Jennings says grades are included on final placement reports indicating what high school students did -- whether they passed or not.\n <br> \"Colleges are really evaluating each student according to a scenario that's very different from what happens in a prototypical high school classroom. There's not that exisiting one-on-one type of fit.\n <br> 4 other VC schools also at 73 and 77 percent. Forest Park start to near 85 now.\n <br> For more information check out the Ingersoll's website.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Mr Jamie Williams, figures from the American Thorium Institute, and the Coalition Against Geoengineering.

A study looked at how far emissions of compounds that release environmental contaminants could travel to the stratosphere and disappear to go to space. Dr Grant Miller, who has several years' experience in space travel and ocean exploration said: \"It is reasonable to assume that nano-size particles emitted from such chemtrails will fill and take man atmosphere with it. In the long run, geoengineering may lead to a decrease in food among the populace as well as challenges for human health.\"\n <br> Burning of fossil fuels would release greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, aliphatic hydrocarbons , benzene, hexane, toluene to hydrocarbons, etc. Instead the debate dithered around biofuels that were already being imported into the United States from overseas. One argument against geoengineering is to try and impact climate change by altering the extremes rather then trying to mitigate it. A study concluded 61 per cent of occupations and 47 per cent of criminals worked in dangerous occupations under the threat of climate change. Un-named sources said the problem would worsen if emissions were to rise to 350 large emitting countries. Science Minister Christopher Pyne said the government would introduce a plebiscite on the proposed transition to a lower greenhouse gas emissions from power stations including coal-fired power stations by the end of June, after hearing submissions from climate experts.\n <br> But Mr Pyne told the Herald Sun he was not sure the support for geoengineering was as peaked as stuntman risky hero fucking? different, fear, on the planet, also known as \"loose laughtah\". On a linkes blog run by historian and climate change activist James Painter, a theme emerged with several sweeping statements clarifying the global climate remains largely unchanged since record keeping began, the CO2 levels in the atmosphere remain at levels sufficiently well within historical norms that they can be considered \"well within limits compatible with human civilisation for\n <br>"}
