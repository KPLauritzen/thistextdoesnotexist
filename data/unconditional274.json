There is no moral problem that justifies abandoning a promise land in which you have-at some point-holdusted your belief that it is part and parcel to have Islamic law in your country. The idea that the Muslims have of their self-rule is such that their success is absolute and their Syrian bringdown is happening as many times as it can agitate some or all of the countries that support Islam in it's mainstream.
