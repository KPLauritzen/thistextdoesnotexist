Ricardo Parra, Zachary Horton, and Liam Coyler face the most serious of charges, deciding to fight the charge after a 24-hour early morning indictment.\n <br> The charges come just over a year after the horrific Oak Park Massacre on May 20, that killed three people, including three children, and wounded nine.\n <br> According to an indictment, investigators determined that in November 2015, Parra, Horton and Coyler were involved in the arson. The indictment states that on November 10, they went to Ripley's Believe It Or Not, a carnival in Arlington to see \"Murder Rap.\"\n <br> >> Related: Murder Rap closing Saturday before debut at Tinseltown Tix, home of Elton John\n <br> The three men allegedly painted its paint roller around the entrance to its carnival, a pair of trucks with sticks at the front were then set ablaze in an attempt to light it on fire. The indictment alleges that the trio used M-100 firecrackers to ignite their own throwing match. Many of the strikes were aimed at the truck's fueling tank.\n <br> In addition to arson, Parra, Horton and Coyler are charged with conspiracy and possession of a firearm by a felon. However, it says that the indictments also state that Parra, Horton and Coyler plan both arson and destruction of a courtroom facility to \"EAT t~e (expletive deleted) pork rub from Plaintiffs (represents) federal COURTROOM.\"\n <br> The accused face up to life in Federal Prison if convicted. Their bodies were cremated, the three accused is reported to have burial with military honors.\n <br> We ask the 27 people who perished who they pray for those who make the massive choices.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Luu hanging bear model.\n <br> <br> This is my first LEGO one in my collection.
