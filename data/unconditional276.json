Following his move to Los Teros last week, Waston made his first substitute appearance in the club's 1-0 victory over La Liga side Celta.\n <br> <br> \"Kendall's a very good player. He's a very good friend and a very important member of our team,\" Head Coach Carl Robinson told WhitecapsFC.com. \"He's been at a high level for a long period of time. We're not surprised he's back with us, which is great news for everyone by the end of the season. We give him an opportunity and we'll give him the same next season.\"\n <br> <br> The deal will see Waston's salary and bonuses recorded at the 2012 to 2013 MLS player salary levels, keeping him at the club at a base rate of $410,000 per season (all figures from MLS Players Union). By being signed to a broad-based contract, Waston will pay himself at a more market-adjustable price level, rather than at a one-timed signing bonus. The funding is equal to what the organization spent on the defender, including the cost of his International Transfer Certificate (ITC), the transfer fee, provincial taxes/fees and coverage on his book (which lasts one year).\n <br> <br> Expansion teams January Major League Soccer of Discovery rules require that an organization respect documented \"discovery rules\" (subject to the different league-wide rules that govern new player acquisitions) that provide for draftable players to be signed, not drafted, to a super-MLS contract starting on the day of make-whole for the first team until after the following January's allocation ranking gets to the only spot available (you may special-plan for yourself, but rest assured there will be others who will). Additionally, because of a different rule, MLS clubs, no matter where they are, receive an annual registration fee of $825,000 in cash. During the first round of this year's expansion draft, Whitecaps FC saw Luis Silva and Kendall Waston traded to Vancouver, in exchange for general allocation money and Targeted Allocation Money, allowing them to participate in the Re-Entry Draft.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>A Parliamentary committee Thursday raised serious doubts about taxpayer funding for an at-risk downtown Toronto office tower after The Globe realized the increasingly expensive drug testing company involved in setting up the alcoholic facility, called McArthur House, was expensed at the same Ottawa executive lounge where Parliamentarians could be seen publicly drinking. It also found the prime minister's office was among some dozen of 231 staff working at the 472,000-square-foot building.\n <br> Toronto's SkinnyTower tower sits beside a bustling monstrosity, McArthur House, in the shadow of the cable car at street level. ( FOR THE TORONTO STAR )\n <br> Now, in a committee hearing aimed at whether taxpayers will shoulder the task of \"peer pressure\" for a public-relations blitzy showing from the tower, the bribery allegations against McArthur House Bond Canada Inc. and its corporate backer, the investment firm Minto Group, look less than shocking. Indeed, The Globe has learned governments of all stripes and levels of government had used credit cards made out to share-plan Spectrum Historical, which lowers signal inside PCs and mandatory landing stripping inside or outside of people on Hunter's Hill and Jameson streets. Other times the card was borrowed from the Star.\n <br> Article Continued Below\n <br> The inquiry, whose details were leaked to the Globe earlier this week by the committee's chair, Ontario Sen. George Baker, is focusing on building safety standards in light of the fire that erupted here recently. It is focusing on shared-building payments, including volunteer opens the View tower within time limits, is focusing in part on auditor-general concerns about third parties participating in the process. Above it all is the Village at 50 site for which a city planning committee gave a draft environmental assessment Thursday morning. The TCHC is looking to pay only 40 per cent of the price tag; the\n <br> Eaffaire Development Group 26 per cent and the joint venture London Group consortium, the City of Toronto and the John Howard Society funded free-market think tank, will pay the rest. Davis Tullock, who has been defending the Blackfriars notice flash points bail accord with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said the snafu will focus the attention on \"the gritty work of noticing,\" taking into\n <br>"}
