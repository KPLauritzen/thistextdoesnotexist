{"output": "\"If you feel like you're on a date with somebody that didn't come off as any of these qualities, then they're probably the best guy in the world,\" DeLia said of her own ability to discern better picks from inferior ones.\n <br> Cook says that dating is a process and the companies who are marketing things like OkCupid and Match.com to the singles is doing them a favor. He calls it the \"cadillac buffet.\"\n <br> What junk will an online dating profile contain? A good idea, he says, is to characterize the kinds of fun things a potential player would like to do on a date. Some potential gender matches will post Valentine photos and describe their dogs, for example.\n <br> Sometimes self-promotion can be just as distracting. \"It must have been awkward meeting your eventual co-workers at the conference,\" he said.\n <br> Not much about OkCupid suggests a female is going to wind up with a personality-lacking partner. \"Are you a feminist? Do you know that on average males have twice as many sexual partners as females?\" asks a androgynous candidate. \"Back on December 10th you will go to church, when you're not on OkCupid friends ask you to learn how to be better at spinning trophies in Oblivion while you're dating a fat tree with a candy ass.\"\n <br> A self-described straight male might say, \"Your cats are cute. Bye.\" Or, \"Where the movie is my favorite place to watch movies? Panasonic IMAX.\"\n <br> Corporate messaging may fuck up your dreams, too. \"OkCupid is on a mission to get us to 'get more exercise,' but we're going to make it harder by lowering your date's rating for vigorously dancing in the living room and eating something you purchased at the grocery store.\"\n <br> Perhaps realism will come out when ranked involve a human being with interests infinitely varied from the digital constitution dream society assigns them. That alone might be enough to suck the fun out of dating.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Title track Studentcard bound invest.: Studentcard bound invest.: Studentcard bound invest.: Unopened book: 1 x CHE 0341st Army Train Division Chiro!
