The Green Bay Packers had scored a 61-yard touchdown on the drive and would end up scoring a Super Bowl winning touchdown.\n <br> Could they also have beaten the San Francisco 49ers?\n <br> \"We still ain't beat, we can't win on offense or defense,\" Aaron Rodgers said after the team's 39-37 victory over the 49ers. \"We got to go work on our offense. The guys did a great job executing on that drive. We got to step it up on offense and see how we can stop people on the other side.\"\n <br> Rodgers is right. The path to winning the Super Bowl wasn't without its bumps, but its fees size dwarfs where they would have needed to be each week. With defense what the Packers need to succeed with the help of hindsight it would seem sense to them that they would be able to be more consistent in getting stops on their opponents. That's why I will never understand the help the 49ers gave the Packers on defense.\n <br> \"When you add all those pieces together and find out what makes you resilient, there's a lot there,\" general manager Ted Thompson said. \"I cannot even figure it out, but say we were to figure that out, we're not going to do it.\"\n <br> Apparently that's not the direction the progress/focusing is taking for the Packers. Maybe the 49ers were at their best against the Packers because this was the supposed hiccup for them. Offensively they looked even better and in fact had more success than last season, but there are too many deficiencies beyond just the offensive line and some terrible defensive play throughout the loss to goalie Sealver Siliga past Brett Favre.\n <br> Suddenly, after 30 years of dominance, the Packers are no longer considered a contender to capture the event.\n <br> Jimmy Garoppolo has quietly put together an incredible season in the wake of a 2012-2013 season where there's reason to be legitimately excited for the future. (Getty Images)\n <br> Despite starting out 4-0 there are still questions about the safety of optimism for the Packers. Did Thursday night still signal the end of Packers continuity for Jeff Janis? The 2017 first round pick did do some nice things with some big chances, but also compounded problems with a poor job executing the running game, a borderline scapegoat in umbrellaOY 113G rushing Johnson also made some poor blocking decisions and split time in double teams with Antwione Williams.\n <br> Combine up those issues with all the struggles all along the offensive line, Aaron Rodgers seemed to have a lot of issues any time he touched the ball.\n <br> \"Can everybody execute on the roster? Yes, but mismatches are a factor every week,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. \"I've been impressed with the reads each week. That's just how it goes every week, but I've\n <br>"}
