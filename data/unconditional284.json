{"output": "If you are looking to recreate products from your favorite films and music, Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) has a big amount to offer.\n <br> The studio is closing down U.S. marketing operation Buzz Guinea in San Diego, Redwood City, San Jose, Sacramento, Nashville and El Segundo, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n <br> SPE issued a press release about the effort to become \"No. 1 in video on demand and streaming services globally,\" but would not comment on the closure. The partnership will begin with in the coming weeks, it said.\n <br> The shutdown represents SPE's latest hunt for employees after the public confirmed that one of its former departments had left the company for Facebook human resources. Other than that, the studio has filed for bankruptcy.\n <br> SPE loaded up on in-house sales staff around 2013, hiring directly from its small team at Burning Man and dozens of product designers, marketers and others as the launch speed of its streaming service, PlayStation Vue, grew.\n <br> The pact comes at a time when streaming services are encroaching on Broadcast TV. More than 8 million homes subscribe to Netflix and Amazon Video while Hulu Original Series shows about to air are taking their consumption to social and mobile devices. Some stations have spent $30 million or more launching new streaming services in hopes of catching up.\n <br> At Sony, public relations chief Beck Bennett recently told a San Diego tech conference that the company hoped to lure Android phones and tablets to the home screen. SPE hopes to market its previously unprofitable U.S. TV operation at home as services like HBO Go, while working with pay TV provider Cablevision into a live-TV hub in the state's Central Valley.\n <br> For more on today's news, watch POLITICO Playbook's clips from the session.\n <br> Reps for Buzz Guinea and Redwood City could not be reached for comment.\n <br> \"As a creative center, we are proud to be part of such one of a kind companies, hands down the most innovative and well guarded\u2026whole entertainment ecosystem on earth. Unprecedented innovation, and a team that is committed to delivering magic, to consumers and businesses, for generations to come\u2026Go make a great difference, SPE,\" the press release said.\n <br> Buzz Guinea worked to implement viral marketing strategies used by Comcast's Xfinity platform to grow online playing time. The company also developed breakout networks, including \"The Rainbow.\" While SPE's network Peacock Network (NXTY) is one of the first to support Sony's titles released earlier, the players are nearly the same as was used by the difference's second network more than a decade ago.\n <br> \"At Buzz.Guinea we produced everything by hand, by whipping out the camera, packing an agent into the car and spooling lines into a script into a customer's mailbox. And we know this rule will NEVER EVER change,\" the website said about the parent company's founder, Shannon McEntire.\n <br> \"Success breeds many more players that allow 'we're innovating' to be elevated to the next level. All of Buzz.Guinea's events expect actors to deliver post-event announcements where each person is ASKING for them.\"\n <br> The announcement comes exactly two weeks after Polystars' regional chairman Jo\u00e3o Pereira told Variety these types of partnerships were overcrowded on the promotional front. Investments in friconsoles have been planned to not only in the U.S. but Europe and beyond.\n <br> \"The limited investment in this budget couldn't come at a better time,\" Pereira said. \"It's about having recognition locally that clients like Sony Pictures are paying attention in the multiscreen medium world, especially with the competitive changes happening around the globe.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Episode Settings and Instructions\n <br> In tonight's walkthrough, we take a deep dive into the top-levelled Draugr that can be found in the Dark Brotherhood starting directory.
