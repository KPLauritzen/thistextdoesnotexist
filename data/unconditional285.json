In January 2014, ISIS seized a multitude of Iraqi cities, making it the largest terrorist organization that includes Kurds, Shia Muslims, the Islamic minority, Sunnis, Iraqi military and officers, and others. Since the local Iraqi army struggled to fight ISIS, forming a government and recapturing territory fell to the Syrian army, domestic Shiite militias, Iraqi popular mobilization, Shia volunteer fighters, Kurdish Peshmerga, and mainly Sunni tribes loyal to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and former President Saddam Hussein. Along with the Fallujah battles, ISIS's media branches spread the propaganda with slogans of a modern global caliphate embracing all jihadis abroad and white American pilots of the Iraqi airforce, government, and tribes. So far, President Trump has nominated forty-year veteran U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn (Ret.) to be the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) referred to Obama's choice for President that preceded him as the general at \"Massacre City.\" In October 2016, following ISIS - the group also known as ISIL, ISIS, or Daesh - that had split from Al Qaeda, Turkey launched one of its greatest military operations in the war against the enemy in November, 2015, simultaneously offensives (talking about the Euphrates River valley), one against ISIS in Raqqa, the other against many positoned ISIS positions in Mongherli, Manbij, and Kobani, in Aleppo Governorate, and against an imminent ISIS assault on the city of Aleppo, also known as Islamic State of Syria. In November 2015, Turkish, Syrian, and Russian forces signaled constructing a coalition to fight against ISIS sent a joint declaration, with Turkish Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan describing it as \"battle for human future.\" During the height of the showdown in Turkish capital Ankara, Turkey was rationing milk when ISIS attacked Nutris continued in fighting around Manbij, Gamr and other militant strongholds around Raqqa. The following January, the city of Jarabulus, famed by the ancient Romans as the Gallic Wall, fell to the units of Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led predominantly by the women and children of the People's Protection Units (YPG). It was a huge loss for the Kurdish groups and an international humiliation for the depravities perpetrated by the ruthless ISIS rule for a year but it did not stop Turkish regime from courting its ties to the fake Russian war against ISIS. After taking Mosul city on June 10, the SDF advanced on ISIS positions in Azaz and Jarablus' towns to further isolate and destroy the militants in northern Aleppo Governorate. In a process that was documented by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, ISIS lost thousands of Legion 1 tanks, heavy weapons, and armored vehicles during their final strike. Three months later, in late August, the SDF captured Afrin, between Aleppo and the Turkish border, and then transferred ISIS's operational command center from Raqqa. The Mosul campaign followed on with attempts by Turkey to normalize with Russia recognized by President Trump to secure the Turkish waters and for the separatists to hold their side of the Syria-Turkey border. Iraqi forces, securely freed from ISIS, continued to function in coordination with those of the CIA and the Kurdish Peshmerga, supported by airstrikes on ISIS and provision of military forces. Although ISIS is reported to have lost thousands of military personnel, just in the Mosul campaign among thousands that operated for the past three years. Mosul will follow it hard on September 10 and its success will reorganize its Shia forces to regain any territory that Kurdish forces have lost in recent months. The liberation of Mosul was a good illustration of how Syria's beseiged population is the main survival responsibility of the Syrian government, the remaining army of the former president stored in the Kurdish-controlled areas. After Mosul, the Kurdish-controlled areas appear to have failed to restore peace in Iraq and Syria, except to improve their internal stability and economic conditions and provide security to their populations.
