{"output": "Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder lines up to find out about the federal response to the Flint water disaster over the weekend.\n <br> Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder was activated to oversee organ donations to help treat people poisoned by lead in a Flint, Michigan, water supply, the Department of Health and Human Services said Sunday.\n <br> Immunity from prosecution will also be granted to Snyder while he is in charge of the state's response and he counsels people harmed by lead in water.\n <br> Earlier Sunday, Obama \u2014 facing the worst crisis of his presidency as he works to clean up the damage caused by Flint's water crisis \u2014 traveled to a Detroit church to meet with water utility workers and faith leaders.

He will also travel to the FEMA Administrator's office in Washington, D.C., to discuss issues related to the largest federal disaster system in U.S. history, according to an administration official.\n <br> In general, the Obama administration has been criticized under this administration for taking too long to act on a disaster.
