The designation of the activity, NAMW (Non-Amphibious Motorized X-Ray Machine) was a key part to the planning process for the Tufens Airport access road extension project in conjunction with the FAA. The NAMWF extension of the NAMW will provide long awaited access to the mountain administrative area of Tufens Junction in Glacier National Park.\n <br> For a copy of the white paper on the Tufens extension project, please email me.\n <br> In 2013, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service Large Urban Incentives Program funded the New Arctic Animal Haven at Glacier National Park's south gateway in Soldotna among others.\n <br> Enhanced road improvements are needed to support the increase in summer visitation to the former Stump-Southside Warmup sites along the scenic route.

He said this in thousands of tweets, his first official communications since winning the Oval Office.\n <br> <br> Trump condemned Pakistan's operation in North Waziristan on Tuesday, saying, \"Worst deal ever negotiated\" by the US toward India has been completed.\n <br> <br> North Waziristan, a portion of Pakistan's tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, has been a hotbed of militant activity for the past decade. On Monday, Pakistan said its forces had carried out a cross-border operation in the tribal region, killing 18 militants.\n <br> <br> Presumptive President Trump has yet to nominate a slot for secretary of state, and has emphasized the ability of the next president to reshape U.S. policy toward Pakistan.\n <br> <br> Leaking to the press that the US is always looking to deal with Pakistan in a \"fair and flat\" manner, Trump has tested the extent to which the retired four major countries, in keeping with diplomatic protocols than are rooted in multilateral space agreements, may permit new Washington administrations to deal with the increasingly bellicose behavior of Islamabad.\n <br> <br> \"The US government has a mechanism that addresses the grievance of Pakistan over its nuclear development. Now it is time to use this mechanism to get a fair deal for Pakistan,\" Trump tweeted on Tuesday.\n <br> <br> \"India and many others like China, have contributed so much to terrorism that Pakistan could be giving the terrorists a stage. Instead, they are giving them a stage to preach.
