{"output": "Obviously a fishing boat to go to time in the sea and nothing to catch or do but enjoy the surroundings!\n <br> I thoroughly enjoyed everyone I caught and did not let a single fish go to waste. My own fishing experience went the way that it was supposed to go. It was not exactly my intent to hook the largest eels though, but it definitely got me there.\n <br> Big sea urchins were a highlight of the trip, along with potential bass. Both of these deserve to be caught! I have never encountered anything quite so vicious and venomous.\n <br> As far as my accuracy measures deal with the water of the river, it definitely was not ideal. To be fair, since sand bottom can of course be just as treacherous.\n <br> There was plenty of challenging and good quality walking opportunities and countless ways of enjoying the surroundings, both excursions in the river involved at least one easy walk; at least which meant I proved it wasn't bad to train and work to go to the river, but becoming monotonous was definitely more challenging than I expected it to be. At least I managed to have an experience of the river, as well as my regular way of taking care of my fish.\n <br> Can't help but remembering dear old Merewyn, \"I shall stay around these parts of the river until this stall and the rough camping spot get abandoned, when I shall swim into them this time!\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Chris Grayling: \"The royal family never receives government money\"\n <br> A one-off payment of \u00a340,000 to Prince Charles would be tuition fees of classes for under-11s, Education Secretary Chris Grayling has said.\n <br> Would level playing ground remain, and would he pay more...? Tom Holliday, Tapestry School, Oxford.\n <br> A critical pupil left at Thamesmead School after he was denied a basic maths lesson by staff, his dad says.\n <br> It came after questions were raised about Mr Grayling's claim that there was \"school\" and \"state\" capital funding, and that the curriculum was \"inter-connected\".\n <br> The education secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government had to \"start acting like a British government\".\n <br> \"I mean if you've worked it out online, and you're going to have a different society, if this means extra funding for school sports clubs, then I think it's an essential way of thinking about it,\" he said.\n <br> Image caption There are concerns the government's claim about a \" level playing ground \" with schools might not hold\n <br> He suggested adding extra money for arts and culture to the 110,000 schools that had extra money available this year.\n <br> But he stressed the public-sector end of the education system would stay the same.\n <br> \"The Royal Family don't receive government money. The royals don't accept state money. It's absolutely clear,\" he said.\n <br> \"For those people who believe there is some hypocrisy brought by the funding structure, I would simply say, no need to bring a Buddha to a Saracenic finest dinner.\"\n <br> Osteoporosis\n <br> He also reflected on the growing scandal surrounding Christianity involvement in full-day state schools and deemed his own country to be \"profoundly hypocritical\".\n <br> Image caption Mr Grayling said the controversial treatment of girls in North Warwickshire schools caused \"deep distress\"\n <br> He said: \"In the modern secular society. the secular and Christian society, we have to ask the question: is it a top-down scheme or a smaller version of that, a unitary, one-connected scheme of all or nothing?\n <br> \"I'm rapidly convinced that the answer is 'yes, we can all agree that it's a top-down model that's not built in the opposite way, where it's bottom-up'.\n <br> Campaigners on the children's health side of things passionately identify with it Chris Grayling , Education Secretary\n <br> \"But I find the idea that you can start to fragment it, fracture it, into social and others and these glorified city schools which exist in London and one or two other parts of the UK is not someone's vision of school structure.\"\n <br> Mr Holliday, of Tapestry School, Oxford, phoned in to present the same view at 8.20am on 1 March, telling Jonathan Sampson from the education editor he understood the pressure on parents and schools.\n <br> \"Tell me about yourself,\" he said.\n <br> Mr Sampson asked about text books - Mr Grayling said they were not school textbooks but that was about \u00a3100 million per year.\n <br> The maths test was, in fact, \"interpreted\", Mr Holliday told him, and did not compare the ability of pupils \"in different traditional ways\".\n <br> At one point, Mr Grayling asked: \"Well that doesn't sound very scientific to me.\"\n <br> But Mr Holliday replied it was\n <br>"}
