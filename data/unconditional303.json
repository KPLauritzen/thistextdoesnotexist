Read the above notice, and see what you think: SF judges' consider a newly discovered isogloss fourth group of six symbols \"confused.\" Hmm.\n <br> Word must have gotten out there (otherwise this wouldn't be a story), because now the Rochester-based Genetic Literacy Project is leading the charge over what to do with the cryptic glyphs: \"Several years ago, investigators for the San Francisco-based Genetic Literacy Project finalized and published a 220-page report detailing their findings from a two-decade-old search through ancient Egyptian manuscripts and successfully pieced together the context of the code.\"\n <br> So says the press release, which promises \"new and expanded information\" about what the #twomariants are, what characters they're grouped together with, and why the math will be much easier to interpret when the glyphs themselves are finally deciphered. The release doesn't familiarize us:\n <br> An excerpt from the report offers a glimpse into the work the scientists did with the code. A code is always thought to be a convenience\u2013a lock to prevent people from reading a given text if it were not secret. In the case of the Azkab\u00e1written script found in Egypt, it could lead investigators to a better understanding of ancient mathematics. Octavian Kamulunga, chief archaeologist at Luxor Archaeological Park, further explained the significance of the twomariants, saying, \"The twomariants mark the way of path of the angels, which the ancient Egyptians believed was key to understanding the purpose of life. The unicursal formula holds link to Egyptology's ongoing investigations.\"\n <br> The glyphs can also be interpreted as asterisks and dots, with 3beltermhebpywocy (\"play away\") and a mesh of dots among them. At least that should help make sense of the matrix Tet have gathered, but we're willing to take the word of the long-dead scientists here\u2014which may or may not describe the set itself, but won't be bought off by tech-savvy sources and anecdote packs.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Trick! I'm actaully not on vacation today, but I covered plenty of ground last week while I was gone. In short, Avocado and Peanut Butter Chocolate Tart is sweet, decadent fun. Use any chocolate chocolate you want, I encourage you to find a recipe that isn't too overly sweet. If you're feeling daring and able to make your own almond flour, make room for it. \"Toro Cadurious Robin Return resourcesFiled under: chocolate | Tags:\n <br> Good cop bye, sorora!\n <br> Bryan #2 returned for his first TechShop BC thru weekend! Arnold and I are doing last-minute checking for power tools, electronics, electronics parts, and all other electrical items done by Gerry. We intended to catch up this weekend, but the fireworks over Florida this past week got in the way (See \"40 Hrs of Disaster\".) I did finally finish off the power tool checklist that was due on the following Saturday and hope to have an updated list ready for the next TechShop weekend. I'll be posting the tentative day of our arrival on Tuesday. I'll also look at my PX2232 vs rg24460 Stamina watch too.\n <br> Swapping limited state rolls over my new \"used car\" \u2013 a 1972 Accent Research Lazer TACT with a few mods: Loop and Fly mod, Modify 6400 (wireless), Amp 4 650 J7VABF that was fried a month ago, custom built speaker box from thin wall, Timp infrared remote, access software Veddapump 5, power adaptor from burned saved plans, Aluminum grill from old Corvette, forklift box from a home-built trailer transport van, and box full of old family photos from the 80s and 90s.

Just like we say, support is key this month, especially for PlayStation 4 owners hoping to avoid Bethesda's brand reveal title, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition.\n <br> Skyrim Special Edition, which is now available for $70 on Steam and PlayStation 4, is a hefty $60 on the PlayStation Store, where it's notably missing from preorder or preorder bonuses. As Bethesda announced yesterday on Xbox Wire, the game also won't have a release date announced, as remastering doesn't serve the gaming community well.\n <br> It's still\n <br>"}
