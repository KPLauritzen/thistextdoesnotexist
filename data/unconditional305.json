{"output": "Firstly the bust apart. then I start knitting, after two bell size shifts the whole thing together.The hide I am using is 2.7mm braid so that may contribute to the backbone look.I have decided to make this with the handle glued on and remove after fitting the shoulder strap. Do not want to get the yellowy stuff on the handle. This could go wrong in an evening. It could be easier to dash off and tell Mum I tore some of the fabric.\n \"Contrast satin cord stitch\". I used to make my own and it's such fun except it has seven colours! Isn't there just one good reason why you must buy a sewing machine?
