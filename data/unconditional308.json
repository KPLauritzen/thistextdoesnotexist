As North Korean officials on Friday said it would have struggled to complete the work in time, abandoning the deal without a replacement power pany may cause the disgruntled South Korea's allies Japan and the United States to achieve what they have failed to do for some three decades: influence an isolated state such as North Korea.\n <br> Obama advisers said they would wait to see what South Korean officials do before determining whether the U.S. is likely to further increase pressure on North Korea. But they said it could become more difficult to persuade South Korea to sign a new agreement ordered by former President Lee Myung-bak after his schizophrenia began interfering with his work and the health of his wife.\n <br> The April announcement by Seoul's presidential office that former President Lee would sign the deal was financially frozen earlier this week and the agency said its agents themselves inquiry into charge at their own risk. The period for signing was expected to be November.\n <br> \"The president is doing this to make sure there are no external parties benefiting from our energy resources either through China or the South and Korean Energy ministries,\" said Lee Myung-bak, 72, the father of the current president and head of the ruling Democratic Party. \"I hope South Korea will be brave enough to do it right after the National Assembly here begins debating the House of Representatives joint impeachment bill.\n <br> \"If they are afraid for the future of our economy, I sincerely hope they would move the bill.\"\n <br> Another factor the U.S. might not consider: that while Lee has continued to enjoy his share of former friends' adoration, his health continued to deteriorate as it has over the years. His recent struggle was a danger to his own life even if the agreement would make sure the specific North Korean-held coal field he wants supplies the total amount imported by South Korea during 2013.\n <br> In 2005, then-President Lee told Facebook followers that he would like to live out his retirement from public speaking including to sit on panels such as that of a female police union and a Democratic congressman. Lee couldn't meet the terms of the future agreement and told the Seoul court he needed the John Lennon Peace Prize to ease the transfer.\n <br> Lee said North Korea plans to continue the project this year and said the two sides could sign a new agreement; unlike 2012, there are no requirements as there was in 2007 that North Korea give advance notice there would be tough visa laws.\n <br> \"There are no terms and conditions,\" Lee said. \"We can build it whenever it suits President Park's scheme of things and President Obama's scheme of things.\"\n <br> The $6.4 billion we owe the North for using South Korean energy resources may become a more pressing issue as it begins to diminish because of Kim Jong Un's load.
