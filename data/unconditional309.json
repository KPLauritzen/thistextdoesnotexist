Applesauce! Smelled like my mom's apple pie at her house. Good update - it reminded me of lasagna. If you like egg sauce - this will definitely be on you next time you make lasagna!\n <br> <br> This recipe comes from a most excellent cookbook called: Old Flourish: Ingredients of Success. I had never heard of the author, but I am so glad I had a chance to check this out. I felt super lazy about this recipe combined with my tiana allergy, and decided to HOLY CRAP TO JUST MAKE IT!\n <br> Maybe un-lazy here is a better adjective, but it took a lot longer in the kitchen than I planned for. I reserve credit for that, but I desperately needed some blueberries in this to spruce this up a bit. Also, when my daughter Zoey woke up yesterday from a cool/cold zen nap, I decided to stop working on dinner and go get her something to eat since she's really a morning person. She started screaming and mumbling for half an hour or so because you boys don't come easy, I guess.\n <br> Anyway, once Zoey got her breakfast and made eggs (thanks SISTERS LEADERS \u2014 I am talking to you too!) I spent the next hour enjoying Adrie on toast that Jacob, my son in law, had prepared in many different colors. The color cachet never goes out of style but finger food at any rate. I was still pouring coffee when Jacob asked what was for dinner and I said - applesauce, of course, for us banana folk. Jacob said it's basically apple sauce. Guess what? He is exactly right. I threw some smoked Gouda on each plate and the bread and I AM THE BEST PERSON EVER.\n <br> I added a few cubes of strawberry, topped it with a zippy pear juice, sprinkled it with crushed walnuts, wasabi and sesame seeds, topped it off with some grated cheese and finished off this smoothie with some Coffee Jack tomatoes. Becuase ready to clear up any confusion that I am not freaking out over this new cooking blog idea I just came up with \u2014 and are going to make a bunch of videos about. I will tell you right here that I LOVE WEEKS! UNLIKE THE REST OF US I start off my workweekdays with WEEKS, never questioning that day. I also love my extra food on the weekends, so insanely grateful for that.\n <br> TLDR - Adrie & Cheese Applesauce\n <br> Like She Said - Cake for Dinner\n <br> Foodie Fwd:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Bent Tree Counseling Services (BTS) has been offering its unique and compassionate advocacy to the people of Northeast Iowa since 1978.
