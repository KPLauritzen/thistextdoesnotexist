{"output": "AP\n <br> Aaron Hernandez may try to go into next week's Super Bowl without a New York Giants pass-rusher blocking for him on the strong side, according to a report from Chris Mortensen of ESPN.\n <br> Mortensen pegs linebacker Von Miller of the Broncos as Hernandez's main blocking target based on conversations with the Broncos. Either way, it will be a new twist to how tight ends have worked in recent years. In a case like this one, a tight end can prove largely unblockable by opposing quarterback and wide receiver combinations, which positions a quarterback or wide receiver to have one of his flaws erased.\n <br> The previous few few Super Bowls were won or lost largely because of tight end joy. The consistency of tight ends in winning the football game has helped define today's game. Teams now build game plans to feed the passing game and leave the tight end on the opposite side of the field unblocked so the distance in the passing game becomes more to this team's advantage simply because the tight end cannot be blocked.\n <br> Hernandez's job as a running back also consists largely of removing blockers, which may be why the Jaguars used him on the goal-line back-field reads more than once in the Super Bowl. He certainly didn't change the Patriots' game plan as much as he also got Hernandez more frequent touches as a runner than he would have by using him more as a receiver, although that ratio was dropping.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>From abandoning the judiciary and judiciary assistants as a possibility to fixing the whip to cut down the age below which they were being appointed and who would be underneath in the executive, effectively becoming anti-fair and impartial to protect unpopular ministers (in case we need to have an election), Lord Justice Leveson spent a lot of his time tearing down the very thing that Prime Minister David Cameron had talked recently about when he called for an end to the culture of confidentiality, which results in not seeing his own mistakes by the press and the police. Because of the \"culture of accountability,\" taking down the chiefs of SFO and GOM, why aren't we hearing about \"isolated incidents\" between senior Civil Service officials, if the documents were shared with the American cable news programs? Do we still need the highly secretive meetings of the FSA where there's a change of policy saying that tobacco can be promoted and kept on store shelves? The difference is that the penalties for not serving your board until retirement age (\"dead time\") are not quite as draconian as they would be in the absence of the \"culture\" from which we seem to feel we are exempt.\n <br> As far as the problems of Sir Stephen's and Lord Howard's appointments and the recommendations of the Leveson report go, Conservative plans for the closure of Royal Mail to pre-empt a possible Labour defeat in the 2015 General Election are the most intriguing. Not only that, but allowing these two men to enter Parliament was supposed to help the Tories at the next election. Do we really need a plan that disincentivizes voting Tory? What plan? We don't control the horses, we must depend on the horses to control us. Who can honestly tell me, regardless of his unpleasant opinions, that this is a sensible plan for the future of Britain? The gender princes of this world urgently need to be weaned off by this and all handmaidens and supporters and staff of them to top up the bailout of the as yet hopelessly insolvent Royal Mail. The expert, legal person in this crisis, CPS Tom Gilbert, has expressed doubts about the methodology with which Leveson looked at the \"confidential information\" in the Falcao/Pattillo correspondence and the chain of emails between Sir Stephen is seen as a curious omission in the report.\n <br> The report ignores all these things which were entertaining enough for reporters including certain papers, the Prime Minister's interventions, even lending British justice a very out-of-date nickname like \u2013 competent, as if it were a relative factor, akin to driving a car or handling a firearm. In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a justice of the peace, or even a junior magistrate, very bustled up then, as their time seems to be a waste of funding and potentially troubling for a big auto dealer in Huddersfield. Of course all of that might be different if No. 10 agreed to say something more on the subject of the high court.\n <br> Speaking of the organization of the super state of Britain, the report is curious about the limited review it looks at the currency policy advocated since 2010 by Chancellor George Osborne and the Chancellor's office \u2013 half of which came in the form of new depreciation provisions for the sterling. Claims that Mr. Osborne's handling of Britain's formation in 2010 contributed greatly to its new status as the world's richest country, was talked about in the report. Again how self-important can one be in asking one's Treasury and Chancellor an identical question for the identical policy concerns?\n <br> One of the planks in the reforms of the NSA prior to\n <br>"}
