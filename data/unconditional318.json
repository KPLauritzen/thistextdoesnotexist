{"output": "WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Donald Trump intends to sign a bill that would authorize $37 billion in new aid to Israel.\n <br> The State Department said Sunday that there is \"a real possibility that the U.S. Congress will move quickly to approve U.S.-Israel cooperation that would deliver nearly $37 billion of diplomacy-driven assistance to Israel over the next decade.\"\n <br> The legislation is due to be introduced that week by U.S. Rep. Ed Royce, a Republican from California, as H.R. 767, the Israel Development, Relief and Security Act. It is named after the West Bank settlement known as Ariel.\n <br> Appropriation\n <br> The bill would authorize a total of $38.4 billion over 10 years. However, if approved under current outgoing law, that would likely cost $10.8 billion over the next five years.\n <br> The bill had previously passed the House on a 403-1 vote earlier in December by voice vote; the last three Republicans to vote against it were Susan Collins of Maine, R-Maine, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.\n <br> The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved the bill unanimously in May. Its Democrat leadership is thought to be trying to pass the legislation before the recess next month.\n <br> Congress initially approved $38.1 billion over a 10-year period in a 2017 spending measure. House Democrats were planning to attach their own aid legislation to the 2017 spending bill, but that provision was deferred in negotiations.\n <br> Rep. Eliot Engel of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his committee is working on several versions of an aid package.\n <br> \"This bill covers the core foreign assistance needs of Israel, but also includes support for other important security-related programs, including Israel's participation in the effort to end nuclear proliferation and Israel's assistance to protect our troops from chemical and biological weapons threats from the Middle East, and especially Syria,\" Engel said. \"This $40 billion package is the most comprehensive $40 billion package provided for a single ally since 1998. I am very encouraged that the Senate is moving this legislation along without delay.\"\n <br> On the debate floor of the House of Representatives earlier the same day, the fight was on, for and against the measure. While Democrats said they were offering a bipartisan bill, Republican legislative aides on the Hill said the latest GOP data represented increased opposition among Republicans in both the House and Senate to the bill, in part because of a 13th hour change in the language of the bill that would have made support for a six-month free amnesty for Dreamers,000 undocumented immigrants, ineligible for aid.\n <br> Listen to the BBC (2:48) concerning DeVos\n <br> Many of who voted no grumbled that this attributed more to access to cheap labor the lawmakers claimed to oppose.

Steve King, R-Iowa, said, calling the the waiving of Dreamer protections an \"Obama-Kerry bipartisan cement-a raw deal.\"\n <br> \"They are not trusted in our court of law seen as a reliable partner, certainly not in diplomacy,\" said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif.\n <br> \"I'm going to stand on principle on this,\" said Rep. Dusty Brown, D-Mississippi. \"We are deceiving this country into a subversion of our values and you can expect turmoil in our way of doing business.\"\n <br> Nottingham, 52 ...
