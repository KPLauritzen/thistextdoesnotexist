[mfw] 12 \"We're walking back toward the bickering and the argument and hearing the commotion, but my husband kept to the wits. He kept saying, 'Shut up. This is boring; walk along.' Descent, he always called it suicide. And he was right, but I love him and I'm glad he doesn't know it.\" Seaman Mary Dearman, 75, of Bethany, La., enlisted in the US Naval Women's Reserve in 1962 and was commissioned as a Seaman in April 1967. Twenty-two months into Basic Training, she was bitten by a stage stingray and sank the cinder five feet. \"They put three boards down in the deep, because there was a lot of solid flooring. I tested for deep water,\" she said. \"I got it! Cold water comes out, my body, you know... I couldn't swim. Murph...I touched the bottom of the bay that she put us in \u2014 the boiling, black water.\" Dearman that after days of fetal position in her blanket, pulling out the gas-filled gaseous blocks with her teeth and pulling out the float \u2014 she swam to shore, noting a solitary calf on the returned passageways. \"I was the only one who did it,\" she said. \"I had relatives that had they passed away in Vietnam. I said, 'Hold on well, Mary. I got to work this out.'\" And she did. The subsequent weeks were a blur of exertion, exhaustion, failure, and persistence. Dearman said that even at home, her husband \"would make us walk down the hallway to the shower and pumps and jugs an hour before he came home so he had time for a bath. And he not only bathed but got a nice shower and shave.\" Remarkably, Seaman Dearman collected 75 medals and recognized awards as a nursing airman and 50 honor medals. Most recently, she received the Gold Cross of Merit for nursing and a Silver Cross of Honor and Purple Heart for work she did in Vietnam for the Department of Veterans Affairs. Seaman Dearman folded her scarf over her shoulders and cracked. \"My whole life I have never worked. Medicare was here in the days, right? I loved my job, but I'd rather stay home! I know what it's like to take a shower, to get dressed, and say, 'I did it.' I'll never do that. I did! Then I'll take a bath,\n <br>"}
