{"output": "By Mac Slavo\n <br> We are pleased to note that the Oregon House of Representatives just passed an amendment by Rep. Nikiya Harris (D-Portland Establishes PERMIT SYSTEM DISCLOSURE GAP) that fixes a rather devious loophole concerning marijuana medical cannabis cultivation by her constituents. \"This would close a little-known loophole which currently allows the medical marijuana production of modest home plants in Oregon,\" Harris told NewsBreaker.\n <br> In March, voters approved Proposition 64 which legalizes marijuana in Oregon, and its 'labeling and testing' has been a topic on many marijuana law experts' attentions due to a lag in obtaining the right for larger licensed operations to be certified as laboratories for marijuana cultivation and distribution.

The not-so-small industry of cannabis cultivators in Oregon currently solely has the ability to grow $500m in medically-processing marijuana annually without a permit. That they could do so was causally managed by OMMCO's CEO, Chuck Rifici, who moved production plants hundreds of miles to avoid the same tenuous percentage requirements the State abruptly created to prevent heavy industry interests from entering one of the state's most educated and scientifically fleshed-out tax-ated economies. A meticulous plan was put in place tasked with beating it out of the balls of the elected representatives of the state in order to forward the hopes and dreams of the petitioners and their pasture plants.\n <br> This loophole plague was a lock-in choke-hold upon industry growth well before 2012 when the Northwest Nutrients Order was created. This small of a splinter collective of Oregon's Namaste joining forces with his alma maters, Northern Lights Chemicals, in order to look closer at and be less hostile to allowing specialty marijuana crop producers to gain the sanctity of grower certification.
