{"output": "Cellular services provider Deutsche Telekom on Wednesday confirmed staff were conducting eavesdropping onto mobile-phone calls, in a new assertion that that it had to investigate further amid concerns about privacy.\n <br> Telekom has welcomed several reforms to European and German record-keeping rules dealing with data protection, including a new clause requiring companies to notify employees.\n <br> But it has not always responded quickly in expanding its email and phone services.\n <br> \"If there is a breach then we will be obliged to investigate further and take disciplinary measures,\" Telenor's general director of intelligence Trudie Lustig told PTI.\n <br> The company did not provide further details.\n <br> Phone data\n <br> Deutsche Telekom \"did not make this statement about our own privacy-protection mechanism at this stage because there are questions attached\", a statement said.\n <br> IAIN MCGREGOR/Reuters\n <br> The Communications Conventions Act says phone companies with at least 20 employees must notify their customers if they use \"the same or similar information ... for statistical purposes or for internal economic planning including for predicting the financial situation of the company\", while, in addition, providing reasonable notice if in the agreement the communications provider guarantees the speaker's or recipient's security against interception \"in accordance with law\", the statement said.\n <br> The act also enables companies with 18 or fewer employees to comply with one-year-old exemptions from those requirements.\n <br> Telenor first acknowledged earlier this month that it has similar business discussions with its customers to disclose that they were subject to eavesdropping, leading analysts to suggest it was investigating the possibility of setting up a legal entity to track people it's in business with.\n <br> To overcome concern over similar companies and other related details, Telenor said Data Protection Commissioner Vera Jourova was \"currently looking into the matter\".\n <br> Privacy campaigners, however, believe industry associations have played down any such disclosure and called for the revamped Infrastructure Certificate Authority (ICA) to be more active.\n <br> After the Tubize scandal in the 1990s, the ICA prevented new carriers being issued certificates, leading, in effect, to all the old carriers meeting similar standards for some time.\n <br> \"The ICA has established in retroactive detail data protection rules for telecoms that contain very well-known loopholes for companies who operate outside the comity rules,\" Peter Buddenhelm-von Kopp, chairman of the European Pirate Party, told AFP, pointing to the one-year delay between calls in the promotional materials for Holm, a telco in Germany that operates with non-German infrastructure Eagle Multimedia Services.\n <br> \"For the same reason, having twisted German privacy law and unsafe material to promote partner agreements violates the no-surveillance pledge of the ICA,\" Kopp said.\n <br> The ICA oversees vital certificates for \"mobile communications systems\" across Europe, though it has been barred from making any decisions about private companies since 2003.\n <br> (Additional reporting by Christopher Bodeen in Frankfurt; Editing by Andrew Roche)<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>\"Imagine, you are actress One, struggling with drug addiction, and you have just robbed a pharmacy, but you need money to buy your drugs.
