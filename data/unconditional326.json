{"output": "No Man's Sky stormed to 100M sales last week with new updates to arrive, and now the game's creators are seeing how the marketing campaigns work with fans:\n <br> \"We know that this isn't your average game now! Usually video games have a way of hitting a certain level of hype and then right around a bunch of huge marketing kicks ... Mine's always been just a lot of us stuck in space doing a lot of different stuff, getting asked about the things that players still wondered where it was coming from. Some players are a bit of a known quantity who know what they like and want. We definitely don't have the most interesting videos that often - they evolve, people can watch them as they're created and understand them better over time. I don't want to give away any secrets yet.\"\n <br> Chances are you've given some thought already about what you'd like to buy/sell for No Man's Sky OTA. I guess the key message here is that you can!

I've termed this intuitive style it the \"index of robustness\" or IPA. It's called Eurasia Capsule Theory because it was my favorite for a while in my field and is what could best be described as a \"guy on the instrument\" in tune to the music of synthesis and binaural beats. The hops, what an isomer can see, can sense, and critics with high IPA scorers (with few regards to the mean or average) often don't need to hear or know much except for where we happen to be at any given moment.\n <br> AA: Looking at your dissertation, you note that Xenophobia tends to be perceived as \"evil\" by Westerners and \"good\" by Russian (or \"bad\" by Westerners). Why are that perceptions of terrorism by Westerners and civilizational threats by Russians seen as two separate phenomena?\n <br> PM: I simply see them as two things that go together. Terrorism and civilizational threats are intrusions into values we find universal. Religious fundamentalism affirms one source of our values as ultimate. Russian at a basic level searches for fullness there and for a complete answer to it. Ethicists are Russians and try to take a look the continuity of our values there\u2014I've seen some just try to advance a position on us (or \"the West\"). Militant anti-Westernists will also rationalize suffering in the world to justify their values. I know information gathered by the CIA, MI5, et al. are collected for other agencies and we cannot read their minds. What one studies from Russia affects us too. But in most instances, I think we have a better perspective on the people, the voices, the motivations, and threats than anything else.\n <br> AA: Your book The Anatomy of Influence deals extensively with how cultural prestige is theorized in Western societies and how it is relatively difficult and almost impossible for people, other than intellectuals, to understand this type of influence. I'd like to follow up on this with your research on the dynamics of Moscow's Washington: How does one even begin to understand such an urban influence on the Kremlin?\n <br> PM: I think that's a good question in literature and beyond, for any scholar or writer. My own goal is to explain how and why the process happens. We have all of the means we need. The power structures in Russia today are very favorable to both sides. They have foreign policy objectives: political correctness, defamation of Russian values, and the increased consolidation of corruption networks. Putin remains popular yet the engines of political power, whose source of power lies outside the Russian borders, have consolidated into a very broad bureaucracy with political ambitions of their own. This is when the venues for cultural installation, originations and diffusion shift: the street and radicalization begin. First, people are exposed to Western culture, which distorts the view of Russia and terrorists. Second, they are created by Western culture.\n <br> In appreciating culture, we have a bias against it. But then culture manifests that bias. Examples include 120Bye, the Google search engine that selects routes based on sentiment. Next time me facetoring and watchdog yelled in my direction indexively laughed. It isn't quite the field of human memory systems that we is the more serious implications of the index\n <br>"}
