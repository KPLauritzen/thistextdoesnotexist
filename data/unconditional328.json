People are now damaging partnerships, family and streets because they're facing a choice. Why choose to make your life as iconic as Little Italy? My suspicion, which I believe in, is that it's up to individuals, neighbours, families which culture runs through. From the outside and from up into the restaurant, if it falls on deaf ears, it only serves to damage it and drive people away from it.
