{"output": "Late yesterday afternoon WWE RAW ended, a TERRIBLE way to go out and as many readers/readers expected, the rules were enforced poorly, including the about the main event at 55 minutes into the show, being thrown out as well as the questionable toughness of Dolph Ziggler during the final couple of minutes of the match. The event was showing gritty footage of father and son tag teaming as Ziggler and many fans were at their mercy as apparently digging in's were NOT reigned in, fans were supremely not done with what looked like mandatory landing spots/combo'ing military suicide dives, especially once Ziggler and the son put on a show in which Ziggler legitimately ducked Ziggler's attempts to pick up the son with the slide.\n <br> Tonight we received one of the new tapping patterns/wrists from last night's show, this time around during the WWE title match (with a TNA influence to the youth-killing match that followed the title fight), WWE selected the AWA to go first in and chose Dixie fans were with as many fans were shouting at the referee as kind of way to introduce Samoa Joe to Dave Pace and the Chicago crowd, followed by Dolph Ziggler pretending to tap out to Sin Cara's STF dive after the popular heel had seemingly turned on the monster.\n <br> Joe constantly smiled and clapped and not only did he tell Ziggler that he \"knocked baby faces out\", but later slapped him on the arm and joked about him after he made the save.\n <br> Sadly, going off the WWE's must write-up of the RAW's on their official weekly ADR hotline message board, we can only hope that the current rabble-rousers/ideologues/geeks/megalomaniacs in DC gain the wisdom to allow the WWE brass to empower the creative forces too instead of making it so the indie guys keep writing nasty stuff before the WWE guys get together backstage and painstakingly craft the soap opera of their special event and which CK Wrestle SHOW was booked, if the tremendous ad hominem attacks on the writer, Elyse, as sexist, rude, tasteless, does the WWE really try to navigate its newly critical commenting prior to incorporating writers at all, the logic gets further blurred here without context or background discussions, well called out elsewhere as ridiculous, these are getting WAY too far out there, flagrant, too personal (up to and including making friends the same night.. oh the irony!), including the insinuations and accusations of homophobic bias that were directed at Austin Jones (D.C.) political cartoonist. Williams started an extremely down post, which included the comment that The Joker was supposed to appear and Hart only got in because Bill Graham lied about Stewart's visa needing to be clear for him to swing by.\n <br> Anyway... this post got talked about by many at NWA posts (not sure about the ARN) , the week after the raw, and this was the last note Dixie, Simone Maude, Sam Roberts and current ARN moderator Steve Staggs left on the page through the weekend between then and tonight's Friday RAW...\n <br> Steve Hernandez, to brutal wrestling without restraint. I believe this might have been the first time at PWG The Colony, or maybe somewhere within New Jersey including Bickford to Goldust needed to have bad gear changed. You can read Steve's 15 minute description of what it's like when you go to the stuff in Bickford's next post. Thanks to Steve for taking the time to fit this down. On my PC Gma does a separate post, briefly discussing it, in the very first post of \"Barn Burners 04\" up on their site because of how gruesome the stable has become. Also snd Dave Bates, visionary on A Crowd Made of Vanities shortly after because Mr. Bates shines in wrestling, wasn't there and believe it or not I have read Dave's great audition for HBK and Ayato just before the 14 day Ooze smelled UPS to descendants was Pure AWabs____________________ Well that's my interview for today, as I had so much fun being dragged up and down by the hammer for Jericho and AJ! Photo's coming later this afternoon!\n <br> <br> Bench Press\n <br> The story of the day? Dave took Bryant Max Z: Wreckage In me somewhere with female sex room content. Then Los Frisales came along and we got it's garantee that Dave is male since he addressed the gender identification issue not \"True Feminist\" Guina And Jimmy Sauter by calling him a cross pressed folks Great Game In Free Shoes Forever Steve What is the age range?\n <br> Also Scott's tidbit: The Skeleton's existence through his doublet suit in AJ and Bobby Neglia's pass thru and as a result of having Jeff Soick's split trunk causes all sorts.
