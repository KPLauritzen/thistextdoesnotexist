Green was referring to an episode in which Sutton Coldfield police \u2013 charged with organising a VIP inquiry \u2013 stopped a convoy of vehicles carrying us out of town, ordering all passengers off at gunpoint before raising a red light. This week, the government confirmed that MPs during Smith's second term as MP for Rochdale would not be called upon to participate in the government-funded inquiry launched last night.\n <br> The circumstances surrounding Greens decision not to perform the committee's botched investigation are still unknown, but he believed the detail that former biochemist Byron Jensen made available a large amount of lines of data should have been looked at before the media unearthed Katherine Cook's allegations last February. \"Why were there not any days missing in that time?\" said Green, who believes there was political interference linked to the use of Dr Jensen's evidence.\n <br> <br> Michael Dugher conceded he personally believed David Adeang's account echoed his father's but refused to accept that his decision to give evidence was correct. The 63-year-old Northampton MP suggested there was not always a distinction to be made between abuse by a politician and abuse by a non-politician.\n <br> \"There's been a bit of cruelty for folk who actually did it,\" he said of Smith's family. \"I've not ruled out that, but there have been known offenders, there have been people who've been very well known to me who have had their citizenship revoked and who have behaved as if nothing had happened.\"\n <br> Others told the Guardian that if the inquiry had considered the abuse against the islanders during his attendance at weekly parties by members of his household. David Adeang admitted receiving third party documents on two occasions. The state of Brandenburg in the early 1980s was significantly worse than today's situation, he was told. When quizzed about this, other MP also had different opinions.\n <br> <br> Dugher has not established the existence of any rape survivors who would want to be part of an inquiry set up to investigate Smith's behaviour after the abuse they suffered decades ago, especially given it being \"bullied\" his MP colleagues had already referred questions about Sunetteslg report findings to police.\n <br> <br> \u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012.
