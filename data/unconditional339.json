{"output": "Whatever the prosecutor decides, Xulhaz Mannar restaurant is closing by the end of this month.\n <br> The company he founded in 1992 has been an anchor in Cedar Rapids since 1994 and grew from being regarded only during the working season to how the restaurant is known at night, said owner Sam Snow. The business is on track to run on $21,000 this year and has been profitable for years.\n <br> \"It's not a rage-filled self-flagellation situation,\" Snow said of the decision to close. \"It's not like 'I hope something bad happens to me.' It's more so, 'Wow. It's 11:58 a.m. in April and I think I'm done as a restaurant operator.' \"\n <br> But the location is a hassle when there are kids places to snooze, he said.\n <br> Snow is preparing his own tapas, curries and small plates to accompany the classical cuisine of the English pub he partners with his stepdaughter, Sonia, at Satara Bella.\n <br> Isabel Davies, who oversees the development of The Blue Room, said there are several reasons a location in the Allen Market Building is closing: its upstairs presence forced out the original space, the cost that draws new tenants and the change in the demographics of customers. Curry Around, a restaurant ODD & TINY has been trying to save, opened in the building. La Adenciana closed in 2015.\n <br> Sanging a strong hand with a sour setup will help but not keep the stall competing against some of Cedar Rapids' better known restaurants, Davies said.\n <br> Snow, who is married with children, said his partner lost a lease because he became too focused on the business and that he once had a horse named after him during the opening of Sabot Espoir.\n <br> Snow, who watched Xulhaz Mannar grow from a niche restaurant in the northeast corner of the Blue Loop to one of the most popular restaurants in Downtown, said he sees a future downtown for his businesses.\n <br> Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2hX8b7O<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Shortly before dawn, on a clear March day, a group of black men walked into the courtyard of the Capital One building on Wisconsin Avenue in Washington and parked a car next to a police car. They lined up on the perimeter of the front steps and inserted themselves into the eponymous vehicle. By 4:20am, an officer scooped up one subject and placed him in the backseat of the unmarked car, locked the doors, and ushered the others inside. (When interviewed under penalty of perjury, one of the five insisted that he would not fight the case.) By 4:40am, Jordan Remick, a member of the Black Lives Matter DC chapter who recognized the car's owner, in a phone interview with DCist, had spotted one of the guests enter a nearby Starbucks before breaking away from the group. \"[The officer] told us we had to go,\" said Remick, a senior at Howard University. Afterwards, she and several friends, including Aaron Barkley, a 24-year-old intern at a nonprofit organization, drove to the Capitol to protest the detention of Remick and others who joined her the next morning. \"[The cops] took a nonviolent person and put them in handcuffs,\" said Barkley, a DC native. \"It's the most retarded thing I've seen in this city in my entire life.\"\n <br> On August 17, Remick and several other protesters showed up at the Capitol to protest the exoneration by the DC Superior Court of James Bunting, who was charged with the 1961 shooting death of James Chaney Junior, who was reportedly returning home to his girlfriend on the night of August 5th, 1941. According to Bunting's story, the young white male accosted the 86-year-old black man and demanded cash, which Bunting handed him along with a knife. Chaney dropped his suit coat and wallet, raised his hands, and posed no immediate threat to the robbers, prompting Bunting to shoot him. Observers believe the 1986 trial deprived Chaney's parents and brother of the opportunity to prove their innocence at the time; only their father ever confessed to the crime.\n <br> ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching!

Well aware of this reality, Bunting's high-dollar defense hearing pitted Bunting, a 26-year-old white man, against Marlinton Brown, a black, 22-year-old student, a.k.a. Kevin Harris, from the Howard University campus. Brown offered confessions on the stand, matching Bunting's story, as well as statements from witnesses who knew both men. Remick recalled that during the court proceeding, someone told her to\n <br>"}
