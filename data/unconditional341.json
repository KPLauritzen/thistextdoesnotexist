{"output": "WVU 47, Eastern Michigan 3: According to gamebooks published by the Associated Press and NBC, compelling consideration was given to a number of redshirt candidate student-athletes for the game, in which WVU trailed 3-0 through the first quarter, but rallied double-digits in the second quarter en route to a thrilling 47-3 bid for upset.\n <br> These statistics were confirmed by the Doug Martin and William Porter press conferences, which no doubt showcase several of the resourceful fighters who surrounded the Shaw and Rettig duo.\n <br> The first game-by-game winners:\n <br> In order, these are the most noticeable performances from the first half of the Shaw-Rettig war:\n <br> Kevin Washington\n <br> 1/11 \u2013 Completions (4-of-4)\n <br> Getting mismatched with Tom Brunell \u2013 Washington leapt 33 yards for his score, taking advantage of good quarterback coverage by Hurley\n <br> <br> Josh Jackson\n <br> 1/1 \u2013 Passing Yards (5)\n <br> When Jackson caught a bouncing pass over the right receiver and turned a teensy-tiny hole into a massive gain\n <br> <br> 2/11 \u2013 TD (40 yd. rush) \u2013 85 yds.\n <br> (score) at 67:10 left in the quarter.

According to figures from the New York Times, the organization's work spread in April, adding homeless individuals to various shelters, taking into account the needs of their family members and making more sporadic trips to exchanges and chain stores in search of blankets and other items.\n <br> Authorities hope the new system, which the city hopes will be a model for other municipalities, will clarify the roles of institutions, public insurance companies, hospitals, jails and nonprofits in transforming people who are no longer able to get by into affordable housing, just like any other tenant.\n <br> \"It's definitely going to be a model for other jurisdictions to follow, and I think a model to change hearts and minds around homelessness\u2014and exceptionally in cities like Philadelphia, on the [working] side especially,\" Planned Parenthood Federation of America's Philadelphia Regional Director Shamik Das told the Times in early July. Community-based informal shelters like the Wheaton Shelter create an \"indoor version\" of the temporary shelter system, she said.\n <br> In addition to important informational infrastructure and language from CSO's playbook, the city received funding and resources to deal with discrimination in job placement for people with criminal records, where for said advocates, social mobility was forced to turn to the back seats of cars.\n <br> The crisis ignited by legal protections for LGBTQ people has forced much steeper attention on the needs of the poor, often in ways as basic as hunger\u2014community food banks and coordinated community food pantries are some of the only readily available programs accessible to people with no other manner to provide for themselves. Through supportive retention studies, a recent Baltimore effort at instituting flexible work policies has trained more than 35,000 low-wage workers on the personal and professional costs of working families they come in contact with year after year. A data analysis of those models, which have repeatedly undergone public and regulatory scrutiny, suggests that following the Philadelphia model\u2014and the federal poverty guidelines designed around it\u2014could result in more than 1 million working parents earning as little as what the national poverty line varies month to month.\n <br> The fledgling Philadelphia model that The Elephant Sanctuary brought to life offers government the opportunity to work toward innovation, reforestation and long-term health in the midst of an already difficult population.
