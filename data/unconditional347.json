{"output": "The pilot of the ill-fated Sportsjet has died and 18 passengers and crew have been injured after the aircraft crashed at Seoul International Airport in South Korea on Friday, in what was caused by an alarming failure of a crankshaft.\n <br> Prepare for shockwave effect\n <br> The work was \"obviously conducted at a very low pressure between 500 and 1000 metl and was yet not approved and was unnecessary, and also very likely the cause of the accident,\" prosecutors said at a press conference, according to CNN.\n <br> The apparent bungled repairs by Expreso Aviation had led to the propeller blades getting stuck inside the plunging fuselage of the aircraft powered by twin-engine Lycoming IO-540, and had likely accelerated the upward conquest of the DC33 78-ions into the anatomy of earth.\n <br> Investigators found 15 separate violations at the time of the collision.\n <br> PHOTOS: Expect devastating results from sending flying teeth and blood\n <br> The pre-deployed company, United Electronic Cargo Inc., filled the intended avionics function fit into the defects that led obstructions to the propeller present in the accident, hastening and creating the crunch that caused the propeller blades to get stuck and somehow Jettisoned the aircraft causing it to unexpectedly collide with another airborne group.\n <br> Expreso Aviation negligently performed a $50,000 good-up while the propeller blades were still flexible and the severely ruptured crankshaft structure, et voila, \u2014 the MD-82 exploded without a victim.\n <br> \"Mine Plane!\" Mobile dad Martine Doranyi hauls away his son Gareth after body landing\n <br> Survivors of the tragedy included nine passengers and six crew members who were injured, reported CNN. Six of the seriously injured passengers were hospitalised while three were discharged after nine hours of treatment.\n <br> Abone the yield piece of the crashed plane was what flew through the windows of the basement aircraft room in a fiery explosion, it was found that some 50,500 pounds of lead could have had entered the motors.\n <br> The plane's tail, its propeller, its windows and acoustics panel were also shattered on the runway in a thick cloud of chaos.\n <br> Another side of @UNEliteSource wreckage was near a building where engine parts were tossed, says examiner. https://t.co/ctTDUwH1LS \u2014 Laura Jarrett (@LauraJDarrett) December 20, 2017\n <br> A residual jet fuel was tossed away by a jolt caused by the collision.\n <br> \"It was the largest deadly aircraft incident in the history of South Korea,\" Acting Director of Seoul Metropolitan Defense Command Lee Jung Seok told Reuters.\n <br> \"We cannot correct the errors until we safeguard our contamination of the aircraft,\" America's State Department condemned.\n <br> Jeez, pray also if the land owned by Billionaire-Lee, who once purchased 70% of Chick Cum sat right at Clear Lake October 11, are exploited with hay. Inpouring anything on Clear Lake will set off explosions lol \u2014 Kurt Waggoner (@WaggonerSport) December 20, 2017\n <br> The MD-82, gifted to US military storage in 1991, was purchased by a posh businessman, Lee Jung Seok, who bought 65% share ownership with Russia Instand subsidiary, Khaddafi Aviation.\n <br> Did the owner do a shock second deal with Egyptian people as likely crew, including 2 pilots and deplorers, there to salvage part of air unit history for making PontiacSportsJet horror @FollowSGWriter https://t.co/LAC7mCEaY8 \u2014 John Morton (@johnmortonajobby) December 20, 2017\n <br> Lee is also the largest real estate dealer, owning major Vegas locations such as the MGM Grand and the Mirage Hotel.\n <br> Closing price? Battlebox\n <br> Mainly purchased for $4.15 million mainly in 2003 by Lee, the aircraft was essentially shipped to Port Angeles Shipyard following a complicated deal.\n <br> In 2017 the plane was valued at around $600,000. It was finally listed for sale on New York's the other Wednesday (19th) of this year. Almost 10,000 shares will be lined up in a private market, with the buyers expected to get their involved aircraft. One major shareholder also owns a number of other aircraft in the United States based out of Domino near Miami, Florida.\n <br> It is still unclear whether the EXPTexas Airways, or EXPinesports will be moving forward.\n <br> The crash, which made international headlines, served as a huge reminder that the various two seats bonded propelled planes are not as safe as the manufacturer claims.\n <br> Share this: Facebook\n <br> Google\n <br> Twitter\n <br> Pinterest\n <br> Reddit<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>more-in\n <br> SEBIN: India's first dedicated antarctic research facility for astronomy and space exploration is set to come up an import from Sea Org.\n <br> R.
