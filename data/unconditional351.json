{"output": "SEOUL, June 6 (Yonhap) -- North Korea confirmed on Wednesday key progress in its six-nation nuclear-free-zone initiative, condemning the U.S. for labeling the scheme as one-sided, in a statement sent to Yonhap news agency.\n <br> The Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea\n <br> \"One-sided efforts continue despite three rounds of negotiations during which the U.S. side never strayed from its clearly selfish object,\" the statement reads. \"Despite the regime drawing peace and quiet for itself, provocations and provocations have continued to be carried out in the U.S.\"\n <br> <br> During the six-level talks on Pyongyang's nuclear terminal initiative, the United States and China have blasted the initiative as negating old incentives and undermining basic interests, further fueling inter-Korean tensions.\n <br> Such longstanding accusations have continued despite the recent decision to arrange a six-day high-profile disarmament summit in Washington, where Washington devoted considerable diplomatic powers behind the initiative after very nearly adopting a nuclear-free-zone version in 2009.\n <br> The statement states that the main objective of the North's nuclear weapons program is their development of nuclear energy, claiming it could not be interrupted through such efforts.\n <br> \"The proposal is divided into nine high-level objectives aimed at democratic reforms among our people and improvement of our military capabilities,\" it states. \"The media erects these two unauthorized realities while hiding Washington's stubborn unilateral political and military policy.\"\n <br> <br> Moreover, it criticized the U.S.'s unilateral moves freezing the assets of banks and businessmen, with North Korea calling it \"pappaCoconut uncure-eeeqisiC,\" or monkey comedy.\n <br> Regarding the Pyongyang News' claim that the U.S. is currently building a war confrontation, the North scoffs at the claim, claiming that the U.S. already long ago planned to set up a 'mini-nuclear state under the 'Mojyun-management' for 25 years.\"\n <br> <br> \"What has been happening is simply that the U.S. is pushing groundless accusations at us and aiming to prevent us from establishing a nuclear-free-zone not being in its interests.\"\n <br> <br> In response to Washington's preemptive accusations by sending a high-level team on a visit to Pyongyang, the North called on Washington \"to make full disclosure of the objective circumstances of this extensive U.S. hostage-taking of the General Committee of the near-breakthrough talks hosted by outgoing U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bolton.\"\n <br> <br> According to Pyongyang News, the Pyongyang media outlet said that the North expects the next round of Seoul-Washington talks aimed at pragmatically establishing a nuclear utopia to begin on Friday.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Caption\n <br> While getting ready to depart for Ceuta and Melilla for our flight from Istanbul to Guayaquil.\n <br> Fly Around Europe has picked up one of our Mirage 2000s on the coast of Islay over the entrance to the River Ness.

Continental Taiwan station 27877 can achieve shortwave readings from + 21\u00b0C to \u2013 2\u00b0C. The Australian data center 575200 can achieve shortwave readings from + 32\u00b0C to \u2013 2\u00b0C. Refresh rates above 25 kW/s (25 Mb/s) causes sustained average readings over the network of + 15\u00b0C to \u2013 8\u00b0C. The meteorological station Uotraa has demonstrated as much as \u221211\u00b0C in one case, but many satellites (e.g. 4665x, 5755x) show cooler readings in the ~17\u00b0-25\u00b0C region. The tracked station, Alang \u2013 Democrat \u2013 Province (ADP) in Ariscal, Maguindanao showed +23\u00b0C on 2 passes (26 June and 31 May in higher resolution than many other sites). More generally, 57+ - 58\u00b0C was reached numerous times and some sites ('hot spots') even in very isolated locations (e.g. \u00b13C/kHz directly north of 1979x and distantly). The network passed through many cloud bands and very humid falls, such as there's now near Calcutta (e.g. in the 17OO0-0O0H0 regions), and numerous warmer decadal and decile range events (there's now a mouldy LD relevance in the 2OO0-0U0 region), and (unlike many currents) never went below \u2013 30\u00b0C on SW of Calgary (+22.5\u00b0C - 3.0\u00b0C, so very similar to local mean conditions there), and over the whole tropics shows mean temperatures exclusively\n <br>"}
