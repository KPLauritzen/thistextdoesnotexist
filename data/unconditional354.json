{"output": "A small and extremely durable CVH roller coaster that's guaranteed to thrill you at every turn.\n <br> As the name suggests, the HQTD Rocket is housed mostly inside of the indoor section (with a bit of outdoor option). There are two opportunities to create ride opportunities at HQTD Rocket. First, a series of four 360 degree turns that end at the traditional two piece actual train track. Second, another series of full rotations end at the station.\n <br> The emphasis in the VR experience on these trains being part of an attraction has been very well done. You get a very good feeling for what roller coaster trains look like, feel like, and are made of.\n <br> The two seemingly fictional models in the QR Atlas, and two cars you can interact with themselves include:\n <br> The Skullcar\n <br> The Juniorizol, meaning Junior Rocket\n <br> There are two vehicles available for the HQTD Rocket, and though only one model of train was released, they're both unique artworks and collectibles. The tanker truck will be available until 2017 and the tank will be available until 2018. It won't cost you a dime to acquire the tanks (adult, etc.) so order today and save size.\n  This is an extremely high quality coaster that's well worth every penny.\n <br> (Check out the Oscar Sanders Link below!
