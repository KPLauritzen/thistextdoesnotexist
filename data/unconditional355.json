{"output": "Secretary of State John Kerry said the White House had heard assurances that a ransom would be paid by Iran to secure the return of U.S. hostages in Iraq, but the negotiations became unresolved and the fate of the Americans \"very nebulous over the next 2 or 3 weeks.\"\n <br> In a statement facing the deadline established by Congressional Republicans in the belief that the twin civilian deaths of an Iranian-American couple in a killing in Pakistan Monday makes a deal difficult to attain even if its terms were substantial, Mr. Kerry paused in Washington to admonish lawmakers.\n <br> Apologizing to President Obama for its premature release, Mr. Kerry said the White House had pledged to work overtime to swing lawmakers' support toward a deal with Iran.\n <br> \"At this difficult juncture, I want to call once again on Iran's leadership to reverse the course that has taken it to this brutal and tragic conclusion,\" Mr. Kerry said, referring to the deaths Monday of Mr. Siamak Namazi and Reza Shahini, who were freed in a prisoner swap for an American prisoner in Tehran.\n <br> National Security Adviser Susan E. Rice said Tuesday that the timing is not right, \"particularly with the death of one American today in a tragic error in their captivity.\" But she added, in a statement issued by the White House late Tuesday, that \"there are other pressing matters at hand, which I will address in the days ahead.\"\n <br> Republicans and Mr. Obama have declined to go into details about the negotiations -- reached after two months of indecision on whether to address the political damage of the slayings -- but Ms. Rice said they amounted to a promise from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to take responsibility for the Americans' release and return them \"within 15 days or we will in fact take them prisoner.\" Ms. Rice said she would speak to President Obama this week about the interim period.\n <br> Among a number of everything-but-the-tenders options, the P5+1 envisages the enemy holding the Americans in return for relief from economic sanctions and lifting of crippling oil embargoes. Asked about the veracity of the word \"enemy,\" Mr. Kerry said later in the phone call, \"I know there are \u2013 I'm aware of opposition on the part of the Iranians, who I understand say they love Americans. But that cannot stretch my credulity. We met on this. This is something Susan keeps talking to me about. When the situation gets to a point where people up here say, `Do we keep the exception for Americans?' it makes sense on two accounts.\"\n <br> Secretary Kerry's remarks followed his prepared remarks to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday. He acknowledged discussions are ongoing but declined to offer more specifics on the Americans' fate.\n <br> \"Discussions you have with foreign governments are always in process. There is no agreement in place. It's not an agreement.. . . I have no ability to assert that when I talked to the prime minister, that he committed to the quickest terms,\" he said.\n <br> Asked whether Congress will take up the matter and sign off on some type of a deal, Secretary Kerry politely noted it was now a matter of the \"circumstances\" and why both sides have agreed to hold off until potential Islamic endpoints present themselves.\n <br> \"What is happening now -- let's call it where it is. It was a very heavy lifting effort, with both sides. It was one of those things where, I speak to John every week or so, and he speaks to me almost every day. There is no agreement, and we worked to try to try to expand the scope of what we could discuss, and it became very nebulous over the next 2 or 3 weeks. We worked to try to work around our belief that no money has been exchanged for the release of these hostages. We kept the prisoner because that's exactly the kind of thing we wanted to preserve,\" he said.\n <br> In his prepared remarks, Mr. Kerry avoided mentioning Tehran's custody of hostages in America, nor did he discuss the nuclear dispute between the United States and the Islamic Republic, where he served as an assistant secretary of state before landing his current post as the nation's top diplomat.\n <br> Referring to Iran's apparent intentions of rapidly negotiating with the United States \"until it has heard from its invisible interlocutor in Washington as to the conditions?\" Mr. Kerry responded, \"That makes total sense. Where are we right now? No agreement. It would be a real shame to see our relationship be damaged over this kind of an issue. Over what we believe is something almost dependency building by the Other. Who's in us and who's in the Other? Not exactly cordial and friendly, which would be at the heart of great partnerships that are formed in circumstances where we cannot agree on a solution.\"\n <br> U.S. and Iranian officials met on Sunday at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, sources provided to Middle East Eye, where their conversations continued Tuesday with\n <br>"}
