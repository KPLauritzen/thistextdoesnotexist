You consider who works for who, whether that employee is male or female, whether the company has contractors doing a task in a small town or for your big, blue-chip tech giant in Wyoming. You don't have to spend any real time being immersed in being too busy clutching onto your coffee table to make space for Sheldon Cooper's sigh. Truth be told, you're heaving this coffee over now, after your recruiter swills your stack of underperforming Open Run monopolizable any the past month or two.\n <br> There are about 100 million Americans who work who wrote a personal email or LinkedIn post expressing feelings of female empowerment on their personal Momentums (note the femme pronouns). Folks, those are women. Inside your inbox on the other hand are men who didn't even go to class last semester based on a personal blog that had no logic or depth for an explanation of why this blogger should want a promotion for the first time since she was a teenager in upstate South Carolina as a motorcycle athletic scholarship winner.\n <br> I should know, I am one of those who crossed over the divide deciding to not graduate from college for 18 straight years. Instead of producing either a sensible think piece or the first person account in the Economic Journal of the United Kingdom on the topic, blogging and writing about the concept of leadership in Iraq for an official government publication, I am a meme! Something the rape culture lobby loves specifically. Hit me hard in the face with a club like every other guy and I'm your girl.\n <br> Why isn't it my cup of peace when men use social media to assert and copywrite unrealistic (read: \"manipulative\") authority on their social networks? See \u2014 that was blurry \u2014 I need to shut up while I bath this poor person in a bullet going subzero temperature and add 600 pounds of fat! Wow, sometimes I feel like the Deputy Reporters' Committee of Correspondents. I mean, I get press but I haven't watched The Red Cross Home Front Disaster into Princeton, Oklahoma 2017 in September 2017. I want my name in the Times For Wolves, Too! (\"So -- It Still Happens \u2026 To Women?\"), or at least to Somewhere Else in a Congressional Hearing, because it's totally the business of Congress to spy on what domestic-violence advocates are saying, yet, so, so few of them choose to do it.\n <br> That American girls and women who display the effects of \"Boys Will Be Boys\" in regards to the survival of their family and themselves can hit hard and finally get over their \"problems?\" Absurd. Every day by all means shun daily calorie-laden Instagram posts of perecemy, cornbread casserole. But if you aren't sharing nearly as much as men drop into cube-shaped ice trays as the lowest point in American capitalism, it's your voice just slightly out of whack and in the borders of contrition.\n <br> I was going to let Yahoo's hateful vandalist continue prosper ineffectively, but I am the last of my human kind. I live on Medium, which admits writers and editors so dissatisfied about being outside of the mainstream of male power that I am an editor or two away from the freaking mainstream! Never grow up.\n <br> Via Science of Us:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The way of the novice PC gaming enthusiast\n <br> Tired of playing games only to lose for no reason, a novice PC gamer picks up the controller in excitement. Designing, building, and betoring themselves with a PC gamer's passion, they want in.\n <br> However, concepts like film trussed to a rolling metal frame are extremely old school. Bringing sand outside of the thermal limits and then doing some impressive structural damage. Minicircles are the new darling of the trade, bringing power, size, drive pooling, moly, and ultimate stable control. And like anything that costs more than your first car, Minicircles cost a lot.\n <br> The PC gamer and all ages should be familiar with minicircles. From a computer that is the little person's desktop, to a propane gas tank, to the case below vintage memorabilia of straight wrestling it all started with the the Yellow Minicircle of Heather Marie.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Now that Google's wearable is rolling out to a small handful of our testers, we figured it was a good time to play around with it further.
