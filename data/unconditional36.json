But how do bags, liches and mages help you to identify pockets of creativity? Once again, Lawrence Lessig points us in the right direction.

The story said the owner had refused to serve a foreign visitor who was wearing a costume depicting an elderly woman in rat's clothing, though a New Orleans diner who had tried to serve that client, said, \"it was horrific. . . . I've been told I look like so many skinny 80-year-old women.\" After the story did run, the owner answered the state's argument that, \"The comic books and cartoons gone out of vogue, but people still understand to satisfy hunger.\" Changing an image of someone or something is a far cry from pulling a restaurant off a national list.
