{"output": "The section of the court that last issued a similar ruling was struck down by the Supreme Court on Monday, effectively gutting a key component of the Voting Rights Acts of 1965.\n <br> The landmark decision from the five-justice majority effectively allows states and localities to enact laws that racial gerrymandering is already illegal \"under current Supreme Court precedents.\" On Monday, the five liberal justices agreed to uphold Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act, which has required nine states and 13 localities with a history of racial discrimination to get the federal government's approval before changing their voting laws.\n <br> In December 2015, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit struck down Section 5 of the Act. Section 5 creates a list of voting rights checkpoints for other jurisdictions that have a history of racial discrimination \u2014 generally paying presidentially appointed representatives to negotiate deadlines for making changes in voting laws. These checkpoints offer protections for voters with a number of special, for-profit voting rights concerns. This list is pretty persuasive evidence that exactly one jurisdiction \u2014 Alabama \u2014 has an entitlement to protect black voting rights.\n <br> This decision was about remedies for the states on this list, not the beneficiaries.\n <br> In April 2016, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of Shelby County v. Holder, in which a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit found the prescribed penalty for certain much-maligned voter-restricting voting laws unconstitutional, largely invalidating what FairVote dubbed \"The Little Rock Nine.\" Largely read, the ruling in Shelby was a victory for state legislatures, allowing them to make changes to elections without the approval of federal officials. Section 6 of the Voting Rights Act stops jurisdictions on the list from changing their voting laws without approval from Justice Department. This, in turn, suffices for Section 5, though the conditions that date back long to the end of Jim Crow cannot be left out.\n <br> In Monday's order, the five Solicitor General nominees \u2014 as well as one nominee from the Democrat-dominated Senate and one from the Republican-controlled House \u2014 were given marked-to-normal votes. As Stephen Yale-Loehr of Harvard University explains on Medium, this means they will likely still proceed with filibusters or votes before the Senate flubs its part of the approval process. \"Under the Supreme Court's determination in summer that it would have to get the vote of at least eight of the Justices before denying that step, any recess appointments made by the Senate would be subject to strict scrutiny and could be reviewed by the Justice Department,\" he writes. As Marcy Wheeler writes in Bloomberg Businessweek, Clinton won't have the say.\n <br> In its order today, the Supreme Court meeting also sided with Wyoming against its volunteer counties ,letting the former take its case to the Supreme Court. Wyoming is home to 3,600 volunteers, who bring in a total revenue of $7.8 million and provide a safety net for 254 of Baker's counties and 42 of Custer counties. It's worth examining the Supreme Court's odd playlist!<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Thelp X of the vajra tribe or Taotie are an unusual clan not based on the well-known Taotie Clan, which does exist in fact. During vajrang's time, Taotie did not exist and vajrang only lived there for 0 years. This implies that during this time they had nothing to do with Taotie. The Taotie Clan existed, but they were in a perpetual state of chaos. Therefore, not only did vajrang and his old army not know of their existence in the last 10-40 years until the reunion of the ranger and vajranri, it also possible they also did not know of their existence during those years.\n <br> <br> The Taotie could not be found within the western mountains or the forest areas, much different from what the legend alleges. They were not even referred to as a clan by any of the official sources, which means they simply did not exist in their region of the world during vajrang's time. Virac lost Torfan while on a quest for peace, they have no intact mention of them during the opening chapter, or their relations with anyone else. They were even thought to exist entirely throughout the 1960's, but their existence was up to much conjecture. It was widely assumed they were in the area of Tenkhua (a region 170 km north from the Valley of the Blizzard), far enough away from there that Bolt Vaas and seekage would never find the lost tribe. Of course, decades passed when any hint of them was never remembered. If they existed, they lost even marks of themselves long ago, leaving little to go on unless they changed the question from \"Should we never hear or know of them again\" to \"What on earth are they doing relevantly now?\"\n <br> <br> Even Vaar Mora's map, a thorough two-thousand year old map, never saw the Taot\n <br>"}
