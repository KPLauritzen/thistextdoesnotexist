{"output": "] Code/Copied from the BCT forum:GT is doing 'Year of the Goat,' a promotion based around getting one one-thousand fake goat horns and items to put up for sale with Galactic Trading Post. (Yes you read that right, 1000 goat horns.)To participate in Year of the Goat, you must either buy one or more fake goat horns (presumably from a planet or a jabba the stain leg, CD cheongsam, or something that hasn't been discovered yet), or mail in a drawing for a fake goat horn(s) or gear that one of the good ingrates from GTP can mark up as they please.The goats will apparently be GTP along with all the stuff they get sold on launch day, or they can win some of the valuable loot that is auctioned off by Tuttle's Credit Union These will probably be sold for in-game cash, but it's possible the goat-horns are just sold at a discount to GTP.After the goat horns are auctioned off by Tuttle's Credit Union (note that they offer equity and not little monthly payments), the content of Year of the Goat will change every Saturday. There will likely be something new every week or so, as much as they want to keep it consistent.And apparently also, an interdimensional desert planet in the process of being discovered, named \"Gangwon.\"Drops to be bought between lobby drop and same-site drops and between planets fall into the following categories :Subsumption of Zealous Granaucracy, Weapons of Need and Despotism, Gift of Wisdom, Binding of Preservation and Reality TechnologyNo. No special order !!!BCT has good inventory management and some VERY big chests:Since it should be slightly random on spawn, will likely be holdover from Beta.The smalls could be sent through GTP as boxes, as has been stated before.No, don't get me started on where too many people collected and sold togeher sheep and vast garbage piles at none desparate grinds. This means they have to more expensive to get their hands on.Dragon cannons have been mentioned a few times, but have not been seen in any game yet. I have been told the Tura is gunnyjing people who raise suspicion about having them on their ship.Gamasutra.com/2017/04/10/star-wars-iii-planetside/ nice body, structurally thought out and breathing, but by far too simple to work in a demonstration and a module like this wouldn't be their first one for next game anyway.There's some thought behind it, but I don't know exactly how it's going to work. It all has to do with manipulating the flows of the mats which can't be used on other pilot jobs. More details to come, but I'd love to hear more specifics like 'will it work with all player races?' 'does it work with modded ships?' Again nothing concrete yet, but will say something real interesting lol.No, as a big ball of chaos without a pattern. That's to make you decide if it's good or bad.It's not; it's decoration stuff. Increase the unrest aesthetics in highways and curvy roads. And it doesn't mean player can't play with these, you just have to be curious, right?<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Every once in a while one of my uncles will randomly ask me what my biggest causes of battle are and then indulge in a good old-fashioned troll among folk who have no idea what I'm talking about.\n <br> For the uninitiated 'in league of legends' is a competitive eSport surrounding computer generated representations of partaking in battles inspired by video game heroes.Players of the game/mod to form teams representing heroes, cast spells and assist each other with their stances, abilities and weapons.\n <br> As absurd as that bloke on the floor before you might seem, playing in league doesn't mean you've got to be mean to other players, but there's amazing expression in \"lol in league\" and it can refer to a myriad of different things. If we can all at least understand what the 'in' means that of course wouldn't hurt, is the suggestion.\n <br> Although in-match criticisms, be they managerial, player feedback, personal or match performance include voicing opinions, trolling and ridiculing others in chat in an impersonal manner have been an integral part of league.It is often been observed please don't throw games to random bruiser DPS who do little to no damage. Other players may be at low amount, may be unable to reposition or may have low farm and money while still, literally, winning and demonstrating against opponents for gold just to use an ADC as a stepping stone to a kill.\n <br> This isn't to attack players they simply do not approach, but the particular style of commentary can often detract from the competition as it can I find often present situations in such a way in the shoutcasting that it\n <br>"}
