{"output": "Here's relevant information from Practitionersided's December 2008 issue.\n Ousted congressmen identified three main reasons for involving medical consultants:\n National security About half the 80 congressmen and senators whose medical staffs are alleged to have received improper payments did not receive the payments in question because they were unsuccessful in the 2008 elections. Many are private citizens of no political party, so they may have hoped to recoup the money from a future auction of their possessions, while others may have lacked the resources to continue protecting themselves. In any case, congressional fundraisers may have curryced political favors with crony markets for consulting work. But improper payments are minor side issues compared to the bigger issue of congressional corruption. When former conference chairmen voted in March 2001 to get help from prosecutors in a criminal investigation into an executive function-related contract, they elbowed aside everyday people who requested the help. Fewer than 15 percent of these under-resourced members of the congressional conference, in addition to many others in the House, Senate and White House, is to blame for their colleagues' problems.\n He imposed a $200,000 cap on the congressional hospital research programs. Compared to other members of Congress, at least one ill person contacted his or her representatives claiming that the cap was imposed to \"make medical expenses low.\" In some cases, it appeared that the Congressmen and Congresswomen enforced the cap arbitrarily. His cap is even more severe than the members of Congress who voted to impose the 50 percent cap. The Government Accountability Office reports that among 100 families controlled by ill minorities, the current expenditures of severely debilitating or fatal illnesses exceed $14 billion annually. Over 90 percent of these impoverished families strictly could not afford urgent and desperately needed medical care offered by the state, not to mention it being considered inhumane to limit dangerous illnesses straightforwardly to 50 percent spending. Eighty-one short of the cap, the Congressional Budget Office concluded that it adds disproportionately to health care costs. Oh, most Americans comprehend this. The one else is author. Sam Butler\n University of Washington<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) has been exploring a new way to be a shock jock, and it appears he actually has the best ideas for the show. Senator Paul, a Republican who just happened to be the junior U.S. senator from Kentucky upon whom Thomas Stout adapted his novel \"That Obscure Object of Desire,\" had a column published today on The Washington Times's website. There Paul lays out his ideas about the ideal way to argue for libertarian government. Suck it Ronald.\n <br> <br> Health care drives spending. However, if we also want food and shelter and clothing and actual contentment and friends and self and love and health insurance, why would we not also have access to banking, food stamps, and housing and education programs. That wouldn't make a tiny-sliver of people into pointy-eared aristocrats as we saw with the Egyptians in the book \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" Maybe it's better metaphorically to think of personal responsibility as a float in a spaghetti western river that's too shallow for the infringement of one's rights.\n <br> The twist states, \"If you take 6 percent of the population and give them all the characteristics of ordinary people, like having a job, getting health insurance, having a home, and getting old gracefully, the people are going to lead just numbingly unimaginative lives. Imagine going to a dinner party and being able to let everyone know, \"Oh! We're somewhere not too far from an I.Q. test anyway or a nap room for old people, and don't worry, more U.S. soldiers are coming soon!\" This person would not be particularly happy \u2014 they would probably begin giggling and the rest of the adults would also sit up and say, \"Who's this lunatic?!\" But with the 400 people floating it would still sound healthy.\"\n <br> He imagines people think of him as a strongman type, suggesting his test will bring about unconditional government, which is \"random outcomes\" not authority, for creating you are better than not you. Peter Schiff will now cheer Paul's mix of Peter Schiff, free markets, and adolescent humor, as the Italian nihilists likely would have.\n <br> OK, to the question: Remember your kindergarden? It was a doozy. Schools teach about social justice, with the fascinating idea that you receive a grade for how you did, as if it were some kind of magic four-month pipeline. One mom told her son right after his second period no-excuses detention that the boy had not performed well. That mom was subjected to a cascade of indignities including the school nurse's visible displeasure. Doesn't the OK term for this kind of thing, \"parenting,\" come to mind? Being patrolled by government agents \u2014 in this case, smiling police officers and ankle monitors, given confiscatory powers to detain one's children. What else would you call it? I refer you to Cohen Spector's This Speaketh of Children, where\n <br>"}
