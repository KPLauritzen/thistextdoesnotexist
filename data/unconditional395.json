Alternatively, you may turn the target into a nightmare, causing the target to experience a sinister occurrence on a regular basis. This function does not impose a negative hit point penalty.\n <br> You must have at least one tier of shaman to learn this spell and can only cast it once per day.\n <br> Major Miracle, Greater School shaman 13 Casting Time 1 standard action\n <br> Components V, S, DF EFFECT Range touch\n <br> Target creature touched\n <br> Duration 10 min./level\n <br> Saving Throw Will negates; see text; Spell Resistance yes Description Once per day, you may force the target to bargain for itself at any meal or event. Whenever such a meal or public function occurs, roll d100: on a 1-10, make the target try to gain advancement on a job or relationship it has, and on a 11-20, make the target begin to fear that a future disaster is imminent. On a 21 or higher, make the target feel a strange tension within itself, vaguely similar to death or somewhere in between. It chooses an action in life if possible.\n <br> <br> Against the will of the target, the spell may slow or stop the target's mental processes, preventing it from performing mundane tasks. The spell has no effect against constructs, undead, or targets that live only near the site of the spell's effect. Spontaneous healing, resistances returned to full strength, and any beneficial spell or spell-like ability that does not require concentration upon spell completion does not effect the target.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Anti-Islam Dostoevsky notes the implied sadness of hearing news of a Russian tourist found dead in a southwestern tip of Florida, recalling a proverb \"Better a dead man walking (innocent) than a the fool dead (vicious).\"\n <br> An American tourist has been found dead in southern Florida, Police and a family told NBC News. They could not say if he had come ashore on the island of St. Martin.\n <br> After discovering the body, officials found no indication of foul play, according to Bob Johnson, chief of the booking section of the Nassau County Police Department, who did not know if the body was female or male.\n <br> Johnson told the Queens Gazette-Express the body was not that of a man and he was told it was not a local, even though the city is in the counties of Abaco, St. Maarten and Grand Casbanis.\n <br> \"Our understanding is that the individual was possibly Florida born or \u2013 coming from Florida,\" Johnson told the paper.\n <br> The 52-year-old man's name has not been released and he did not have identification, police said.\n <br> Local police were going by the name \"Capt. Keith\" but they later corrected it to \"Pt. Tim\" following confusion in local media. Lt. Patrick Spence of the Nassau County Police Department told the Queens Gazette-Express the sheriff believed the body was that of Pennsylvania native and a veteran of the Russian Navy 235th Ship or Noga, which he was on with a Florida agency and was due to return Aug. 31.\n <br> A friend of the deceased announced his death in a post on his Facebook page - but would not say where the body was found on the Caribbean island. Corrine Noll also said the man died during a boat trip from Abaco to St. Maarten. Nat Peterson who was taking part in the trip said that his girlfriend was disoriented when she arrived in St. Maarten.\n <br> \"She told me she was on her island of St. Maarten with her family heading to the Miami area,\"\n <br>"}
