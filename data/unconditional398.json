{"output": "'I don't have a problem with that \u2014 it's called freedom of expression.'\n <br> If any, that is, as, perhaps, the ready counter argument would suggest.\n <br> Throughout the nation Friday, reaction to the horrific mass shooting at a community college in Oregon was sharp and widespread. From the student body at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Oregon, to dispensaries and artists, America debated the meaning of free expression while fighting for those at the Oregon campus. Here, the teen accused of the shooting's alleged rampage takes refuge.\n <br> Alex Gilliam, 13, the alleged shooter in the Oregon community college shooting that killed nine students and a teacher Friday, is shown in an undated photo provided via the Roseburg Police Department. (Roseburg Police Department)\n <br> Oregonians have a complicated relationship with guns. Although gun control legislation is among the most restrictive in the country, many Oregon residents I've spoken to are reluctant to take action on gun safety legislative proposals and are more focused on ensuring their right to self-defense. They see current gun laws \u2014 especially related to carry laws \u2014 as loosely fashioned rules of nomenclature that don't actually reflect actual law enforcement safety knowledge.\n <br> But.\n <br> Democratic lawmakers, loathe to be portrayed by the loathing of liberals and the general antipathy they have at times towards the national gun control debate, are stepping in to help Oregon carry out its natural tendency of embracing unpoliced firearms and gun safety legislation.\n <br> Armed on every college campus?\n <br> On Friday, media outlets reported dramatic probes by police onto campus armed on Office wearers during the chaos. Freshman Kenrick Monfils, a sociologist at the University of Oregon and outspoken gun owner, expressed the degree of panic the place sparked amongst both students and professors.\n <br> \"It was really like a war zone in terms of all the security that was over there,\" Monfils told the NPR affiliate KUTW Friday night. \"People were searching everywhere. It was like a war zone.\"\n <br> Another unidentified sophomore Spencer Graffitti, a business major at the school with Second Amendment rights, told OregonLive Friday night that the armed security kept students and professors on edge as the scene unfolded hot off the presses.\n <br> \"It was a stressful night, but now that the police have removed any threat there's a lot of relief,\" Graffitti said.\n <br> Just think: Go ahead and carry a concealed gun on campus. Here's what you need to know.\n <br> School shootings are thankfully relegated to occasional memory. Few and far between. \u2014 Austin Darius (@ajdarius) October 1, 2015\n <br> Ordinarily, when on his way to the parade, I would club students before my time.

A primitive man wakes up powerful.\n <br> Trouble rages for more than three hours, raising some concerns over gun law enforcement skills among the law enforcement officers in Oregon.\n <br> \"Our terrorist events for two years in a row are made easier by the lack of attention that the hyper-violent shooters get from authorities,\" Oregon U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D) said. \"It's suddenly ok for a craaaaaazy and violent young shooter to rampage through a school full of innocent young students and massacre them. Well, it's actually ok now until he's done it four or five more times.\"\n <br> Gun advocates argue law-abiding students should be more concerned with how fake news media types and presidential candidates are stoking the violence than by how our government tells us to feel and feel that we should arm ourselves. People access cell phones today at reasonably funded prices. In the long run, America's consumers will decide their own gun laws, including access to firearms. Will perhaps best be fulfilled by the diversity of views in the public square.\n <br> Kelly Jacoby Snyder: 206-464-2249 or kj Snyder@seattletimes.com.
