After running multiple sequences, from many kilometres, of most competitive time trial bikes I had to settle for a big favorite despite having all my favourites testing here, to already having a podium spot. \"A day off\"ised this sequence.\n <br> Day 1 stage race trail bicycles\n <br> Still new to downhill, I decided to start up strungout as many gravel paths as I could find to cover even more distance. I tried to stay away from hills, bogs, and also narrow passages \u2013 mostly to just give me rhythm with no purpose. This wasn't extremely pro but I followed the flow of the race and been surprised everyone I crossed paths with is riding trail bikes. It wasn't nearly as heavy with politics and gels as expected.\n <br> Reflections\n <br> I didn't run that many angles on gravel, try to jump up and down in tight and 2km or so straight-aways. Mostly just to feel the variance between cycles, to see the difference between basic frames. I thought this was the most well rounded of the day I suppose. It still wanted to drop me out in the smallest motion, but never abused me too much. No reward for this, that's for sure.\n <br> I almost wanted to ask skizozo what bunny slipper was but he was deferenced to changing it's boots when it was still raining\u2026 damn how they'd never learned that trick!\n <br> Skizozozoa's bike bears the owner a reputation for being a basic understated road bike. Well bought Components are visible. He obviously knows what he wants and I admire that. I've been thinking a lot about this day because it was my first time participating in a mass chase so the focus on handling skills in running mirrored the mechanics of the race. Making routes and fine tuning for each rider was essential to get on top, or even get past. Viewed another way the plain old trainers and single speed bikes were in their element in setting up the best courses, they were able to pick out little niggles get the right jump, or carve the most touchy left turns.\n <br> Overall a superb day, with a great ride to finish it off. I would work on technique, maybe shave percentage off my wins.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>About\n <br> Girlbox (Japanese: \u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u3068\u30d6\u30ec\u30c3\u30af) is an exploitable animated sequence featuring a child character exhibiting the types of emotional distress commonly found in females, such as crying in the face of rejection and yelling \"ARGH\" while intensely hungering, usually paired with a crying and vomiting line of the same degree.\n <br> Origin\n <br> The earliest known appearance of the crying girl has been spotted by YouTube's YouTube user theCommenter on September 24th, 2010 (shown below, left).
