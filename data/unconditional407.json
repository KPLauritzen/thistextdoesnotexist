Gensler Inc. is the only known building contractors to have displayed interest for the viable opportunity.\n <br> The latest RFP, issued in mid-May by Gensler's Cleveland office, noted that the firm had completed a similar volume of development projects in the Cleveland area that included Hilton, Progressive National Bank and Steer Wellness Center.\n <br> A shorter timetable and a stiff competition, however, may push the project to 2016.\n <br> The East County Health Center site, unlike Uptown, will have before it an overpass reconstruction planned for Public Square 2014, a rising on-ramp constructed in September 2013 to complement a similar project upriver of Jackson Square, and ramped that header wider than intended from about 50 feet in the northeast direction to the River Walk, pending city review, sources confirmed.\n <br> White said a total 9,000 square feet will be open to the public.\n <br> Changing the mix at the West River Street site could mean a neighborhood-scale green plan, intended to provide residents with plenty of options for personal bathing and other wellness facilities.\n <br> Since 2000, located on the border of North Slauson and St. Louis Park, the area has housed numerous apartment complexes and has been without a decent grocery store closely monitored by East County residents' burgeoning need for it, residents said.\n <br> For much traffic wanton destruction of homes, support came from two of Obama's ordinances and The Tragic City Design Plan stirred up dramatic alarm in east St. Louis Park, with regular reports of North and Northeast R St. neighbors with signs posted and screams triggered over the issue.\n <br> The final, tentative design, by a firm calling itself LiNUM Architecture/Design of St. Louis, will include, officials said, a purchase of St. Stanislaus Roman Catholic Church grounds for the next seven to 14 years for Pope Francis's practice \u2013 a $200,000 cost for the Diocese.\n <br> Other advantages of opting for a nearby office park-like development were that it will rejuvenate a blighted area, remove a tax-problem from Medina Park, give some residents new infrastructure, more... and fill East County Health\n <br>"}
