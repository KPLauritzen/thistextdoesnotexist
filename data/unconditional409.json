Mandatory Credit: Eric Bolte-USA TODAY Sports\n <br> A slew of possible destinations were discussed among the mayors and league owners at this year's Winter Meetings, and one name is by far the most talked about.\n <br> One name that seemed to impress everyone during the 2017 NBA All-Star Weekend in Toronto is not only intriguing, but probably the most important hire of all the new additions. And by the looks of it, Claude Giroux is going back down to his roots.\n <br> The Philadelphia Flyers forward, who now guested with Bob Costas for the NHL's all-star break, is reportedly going back to his native The Netherlands for its national team players and coach, the two in Peter Bakker, of the Netherlands.\n <br> Of course, coming from The Netherlands, Giroux's apparent feeling of na\u00efvet\u00e9 is located at the root of this whole potentially perfect scenario; he has yet to play a football game, how can he know what to expect as a professional player?\n <br> That's not Maarten Alquoode's issue either, now a solid NHL winger over the past several seasons, who started entire scoring droughts in the Netherlands, including in countries like Kazakhstan and Australia.\n <br> Would it see Giroux playing in different leagues like he did during his last short stint in the league, starting in Oshawa, in 2004-05? Not if he signs back with the Flyers before the playoffs begin in earnest.\n <br> It's essential, of course, that Philadelphia's insurance policy is filled with NHL players, who aren't only at home most of the day, but also are each capable of fulfilling day-in, day-out duties without hindrance. The addition of Bakker, the former trainer for the Netherlands U-19 national team, will come as a playoff ticket to fill in other areas in the Cup Final push to get over the hump. It may be Lightrott or Letestu who chip in for the goal's novelty, and the unexpected addition of Paul Holmgren who he moved his family down to Johor Baru to be closer to their mother.\n <br> After all, as Benny Computer once said, patience isn't the same as giving up, especially when you are as certain as Mr. MacGillivary of the Captain giving not only the Flyers the green light to pursue this signing as soon as possible.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Still loading...\n <br> A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z AA AB AC AD AE AF AG AH AI AJ AK AL AM AN AO AP AQ AR AS AT AU AV AW AX AY AZ BA BB BC BD BE BF BG BH BI BJ BK BL BM BN BO BP BQ BR BS BT BU BV BW BX BY BZ CA CB CC CD CE CF CG CH CI CJ CK CL CM CN CO CP CQ CR CS CT CU CV 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100\n <br> Loading...
