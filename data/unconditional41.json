{"output": "As the Patriots win their fifth straight, they enter the bye week of 2015 hotter than ever. And with a rough loss against the Dolphins last weekend they will be almost a perfect 5-0 when they come off of the bye.\n <br> They have the perfect opportunity to improve on last years 2010 season with the ability to win four consecutive games for the first time in their history.\n <br> Are Tom Brady & Co. ready for the challenge? Or more realistically, will the entire team numbes up to the challenges of a Patriots game?\n <br> Find a Breakout Star\n <br> I have made the case to replace Blount both in the backfield and in the pass game after seeing plenty of glimpses of DeAngelo Williams in Week 4 and 5. It should be noted that Williams finished the game as the third leading rusher with ten yards on four carries.\n <br> Other running backs such as Dion Lewis and James White are also being looked upon to make plays, which should result in an improving offense.\n <br> Matthew Slater's two seasons mark are over for now with the signing of former Texans Safety D.J. Swearinger. Slater will likely spend a lot of time at Hargrove and Hamilton's covered free safety positions.\n <br> If I had to pick a breakout player for this upcoming week, it would be running back Tommylee Lewis just looking on as a look at replays, try to get more reps, how he runs with contact, changes of direction and in general schemes and concepts.\n <br> Easiest Defenses to Stop\n <br> There has never been a truly hard defense for the Patriots, this week they'll face one that I think is the hardest early season test they have faced to date.\n <br> The walls have never been crumbled by New England, but I believe they are crumbling. I'm not necessarily referring to the execution of their schemes, but more the process from scouting to gameplanning to execution.\n <br> Am I going to call them physical? Absolutely. The Giants certainly wore out the Patriots defense over the first two seasons of their rivalry. However, I'm looking at how many opportunities they had with the same technique and technique.\n <br> For a team that I believe can have issues on a few different aspects especially in the run game, I think this matchup will be extremely easy to stop.\n <br> The Giants did a good job with how they are able to counter the Patriots third down defense. Another thing that I believe Giants fans should be wondering is how far they can widen out the field on a run on third down for such a top-tier pass defense like the Patriots.\n <br> While the Giants took 12 shots on designed runs and targets on 53% of their drives last year, the Patriots allowed just one false start attempt on third down and they're something to watch this week.\n <br> Although New York started well against the Giants in Week 2 and quickly overwhelming them with offensive success, the progressions weren't smooth at times- that was the biggest problem for the Giants offensively that failed to retain momentum on offense after halftime.\n <br> The reason for me writing this couldn't be instead of offense when Wilson ran for 165 yards in that game, a mark that primed the pump for defense's jersey to see widespread selling early, perhaps it was the application of those figures this week when the defense will have two of their stars, Lewis and Dumervil mentally drained from being relegated to sub-packages late in games and in the playoffs.\n <br> Ironically, it was one of those versions of the Giants' skill position players that really pushed Landon Collins into a chip on his shoulder looking for a reach on a San Francisco receiver on that dangerous fourth quarter drive.\n <br> Am I going to fret over stopping the run versus San Francisco? No. I just can't gauge or book it till the moment I dig into their game plan in preparation, in any case, this week I anticipate a run heavy attack versus the New England rushing defense.\n <br> 4 Factors Will Be A Critical Personality in This Bye Week\n <br> I could go on and analyze the changes in the New England. However to equally evaluate the team and its current roster this week, let's look at four key factors.\n <br> (1) Rock Bottom and Big X Factor: Tom Brady & Coach Belichick\n <br> I'm not going to start talking about cancer, a grim mental abyss, something beyond belief or a legendary coach simply to talk about how one of their greatest players could have would be emotionally painful to watch.\n <br> However, unlike Ryan the trophy happy-ticket drive-to-the-crowd driver over the first two seasons may be a chimera when Brees takes his anger out on the next opponent.\n <br> Brady has been his own worst nightmare on and off the field. He has become confident enough in his command to pursue with a coach that is giving him ability to make plays wherever he may be. His relentless drive to break every single record in the pile, grew further every month.\n <br> He broke the record for most game-\n <br>"}
