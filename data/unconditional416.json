This debate dolores the way we use technology and how designers should be responsible for running the gamut from working on projects to making them successful.\n <br> The debate:\n <br> Designers: \"I just have the graphics and metadata for my app plan.\" Designers: \"Work on the ok Google!, like a second\", and options.\" Designers: \"I'm initially struggling with the Oculus Rift Development Kit drivers.\" Designers: \"I thought it was clever and then realised how dumb I was. Despite having the hardware we needed and messing with it so we had a proper trial-and-error build.\" Designers: \"My project crashed the virtual reality kookaburra\" Designers: \"I had to make a new mental map of the ideal graphical setting due to crashing about the store.\" Designers: \"Are you supposed to have the heart and soul of an editing company? Yes? Bitch a mile, I guess.\" Designers: \"What is it about B&W that makes it a fit for this VR\" Designers: \"It's looking ugly, no?\"\n <br> Some people have solutions in mind via changes to the user interface and application architecture that would make creation faster with less work for developers. Some are more along the lines of \"This is awesome and it'll all work out\" type of behaviors. What do you think are the principles that bind you to your work?\n <br> Clearly designers need to be handed the reins of their work. It's encouraging to see the way they're using virtual reality to push forward the imagination of our industry. We'll begin monitoring how guidelines are being applied by virtual reality designers and want to hear from them to ensure they are executing on the many pieces of information listed above. Do you have some examples of how you were able to visually qualify your work? Please include examples of how others were not. Also, be on the lookout for double discussions.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n <br> President Donald Trump on Thursday paid tributes to Confederate generals Friday as he said the \"respect of our country is at an all-time high\" after a solemn ceremony in rebel-held Durham, North Carolina.\n <br> Before devoting a significant amount of his remarks to the death of Heather Heyer, the 32-year-old woman who was killed when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters, Trump referenced the importance of ensuring that the nation's eight remaining Confederate monuments are not torn down.\n <br> Those monuments would eventually become a focal point for the group of followers eager to keep conversations about Confederate symbols at bay.\n <br> Related: All Flags Above Focus: Nathan Bedford Forrest Backs Trump\n <br> \"There's never been anything so astounding in our nation's history as the gathering of the men who died to do everything they tried to prevent 190 years ago,\" he said. \"And they will hopefully never be forgotten.\"\n <br> Take NBCNews.com Tour\n <br> At the height of a weekend protest of the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, Trump defended the statue, saying it did not depict the Gen. Lee in historical accuracy.\n <br> (Whitney Leaming and Mark Berman / The Washington Post, the Washington Post)\n <br> The president quickly condemned the violence that forced the removal of that statue. Two Virginia state troopers were killed when conservative activist James Alex Fields Jr. rammed his car into counter-protesters. Fields was charged with murder and remains in jail without bail.\n <br> Trump defended remaining Confederate monuments Thursday, however, saying they were \"worth saving.\"\n <br> \"For years and years, it's been a problem,\" he said. \"And it's going to be a problem for a long, long time.\"\n <br> Trump has called for more robust public discussion of the cultural significance of Confederate symbols since he took office.\n <br> His fundraising effort to remove the Lee statue earlier this month resulted in hundreds of thousands of donations from around the country.
