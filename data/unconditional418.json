{"output": "Dubai, May 23 (ANI): The United Arab Emirates has ruled out launching its own mobile phone network.\n <br> \"Emirati News Agency (AWA) has clarified that there are no plans that the United Arab Emirates will launch a mobile phone network,\" the country's Communications and Information Technology Commission (CITC) said in a statement.\n <br> The telecom body said this after a report in a foreign media that UAE was considering launching its mobile phone from the name UAE Next Generation Products.\n <br> The report additionally said that the UAE, a state with a population of 5 million, had set itself as among the top three mobile phone operators globally according to a report by GSM Association.\n <br> \"Money bill in UAE is retail subscriber adds of 15.4 per cent that is above the global average,\" UAE News Agency reported.\n <br> It added that the revenue per subscriber was 200,000 Dhs a month which is around 3,000 per user.\n <br> The UAE had in the past launched an 'Intellicom' service that offered virtual lines compared to others.\n <br> PTI<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>According to a report by the Associated Press:\n <br> \"Democrat Doug Jones on Saturday played down the importance of a Northern Alabama Senate seat in the race to fill Jeff Sessions attorney general's old Senate seat, harshly criticizing Sen. Luther Strange. Without saying that he was quitting the Senate race, Jones said GOP candidate Roy Moore wouldn't be able to protect President Donald Trump Donald John TrumpHouse Republican threatens to push for Rosenstein impeachment unless he testifies Judge suggests Trump's tweet about Stormy Daniels was 'hyperbole' not defamation Rosenstein faces Trump showdown MORE by opposing arguments on abortion, health care, border security and campaign finance laws.\"\n <br> The report continues:\n <br> \"In a no-holds-barred attack on Strange, the former judge is charging that the incumbent of Alabama's Republican primary painted himself as a friend of President Donald Trump by supporting Trump's presidential campaign. Moore is prepared to savage the revelations that fired FBI Director James Comey made a startling announcement Wednesday about the bureau's Russia investigation, laying out the accusations and saying they present a conclusive defense of the president's character. 'Roy Moore is using former federal prosecutors to attack Roe v. Wade, the identification of race based discrimination, and the political correctness of the United States of America. That's what he's preparing to change because he's kind of a modern Forrest Gump,'\" Jones told reporters at a Saturday rally.\"\n <br> That has an interesting implication, too. How much damage can Roy Moore do with a Democrat holding Attorney General Jeff Sessions's former seat in Alabama, sooner or later? How can Moore cut him down until only Moore, possibly, is left standing after the 2018 midterm elections?<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>README + TWITS\n <br> A curated article list to help you find Google News articles which have been recently published or are well worth reading.

A man named Michael Young, who works at a fast food restaurant in Gawker, only somewhat phrases it as \"engineer representing his video-game store founded in June.\"\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> Another, from Presque Isle, was said to have clipped a steel rod known as a \"float\" during its landing prior to its capture by the CIA. Today the National Transportation Safety Board traces those floats down to the White Plains outskirts of New York City. Shortly after Young's plane entered the Port Authority airspace, FAA radar alone could detect his plane's departure, hail its approach, horizontal gain of 300 feet, and then its landing at the runway in Uniontown. Though data off the New York radar stations show that Young did not speed, engineers expect traces left on the jet to track further regression.\n <br> Young says the intrepid miners he hired to cut the float, as if there were any such working miners in that area, refused to check and noticed his plane was not caused by one of their machines, and circled it with their other tools. Young says the miners just cut the float to stop it rumbling down.\n <br> It was the difference between \"Al-Qaeda bombs in black truck\" and \"Alias Fateh Afghanistan dumped black truck down the scrap heap.\" Today the crash site is much less recognizable. Young's house was largely unlit as barely two feet of remaining rainwater was probed for evidence, but there were only three shallow torn blades of grass, no eons-old basswood floors, and not a single scrap of landscaping with the density of \"the very hairs standing at the edge of your bonnet\" at Williamsport or\n <br>"}
