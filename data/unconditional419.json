He was barely involved in the game and posted a 0.82 GAA and .939 save percentage if we exclude the penalty kill.\n <br> The Knights' general manager, John Chayka, gets asked about the veteran goalie's season frequently during Arizona's media session. He has been thoughtful and diplomatic with his answers, but over the past year and a half the concern about Oliver has grown louder.\n <br> Team president Patrick Roy often calls Oliver the team's best player, a statement repeated by management that even prompted Coyotes CEO Anthony LeBlanc to comment on Twitter Wednesday. Oliver has gone from public darling to the butt of the jokes, and on Thursday he commented on the chip on his shoulder in a news conference in northern Alberta.\n <br> NHL.com's Chris Johnston and TSN.ca replayed the conversation in respect to Cole also sharing the postgame meal with Ralph Krueger and dressing in a Etobicoke Federal Buildings jacket with Wayne Gretzky's No. 10 jersey on it. Hilary Knight volunteered that she had connected Kreider ahead of tonight's rematch with New Jersey but Coach Dave Tippett wouldn't offer a reason for her objections.\n <br> And near the end of his answer, Chayka said: \"I think at some point when you lose just a couple of games, inevitably (Oliver) will have some time on his hands.\"\n <br> To those who contend that toughness equals playoffs, that wasn't too far off the mark.\n <br> Let Parm to suffer alone\n <br> The Charity Finder plight singles speak to the matter of playmaking duo Syl Apps and Russell Anderson.
