{"output": "She was baptized at age 8, was married at 19 and had a son by age 25. Janson Worrell spent his 17-year-old life getting high off drugs: crystal meth, ecstasy, acid and, eventually, once he ran out of drug, heroin. He was arrested since the age of 19. At minimum, he went to prison for about 10 years, leading up to his plea bargain for drug possession.\n <br> During that time, Worry got married and started a family. His own mother stopped by thanking him for a young life.\n <br> \"Take care of your family,\" she told Worry.\n <br> Too bad his life ended not too long after Worry was released from prison after completing his sentence. He was the subject of a shooting after a high-speed chase. Police say his vehicle struck a deputy and a man at speeds up to 137 miles per hour. The deputy was killed and the man injured.\n <br> Worry reportedly thought he told the cops he had a gun. He was later told he had one right in his back pocket.\n <br> \"All throughout, I kept telling somebody: any minute you're going to have a gun held to you. I said absolutely not; it's the gun she gave me for Christmas,\" Worry said in an interview with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in October of this year.\n <br> Worry is now 26. He is serving a 15 to 20-year sentence for second-degree murder. The family asked the judge that the least 10 years needed for his resumption of his life after prison. As for that $3.4 million house\u2013that's where he's at now.\n <br> I met Janson Worrell at the StormLake Jail on Monday, where he says he has been confined since April 23. He was reluctant to talk about his past so he asked that my photographer get permission before talking to me. I did, I was allowed. Worrell has a wide smile and a complete disregard for the guidelines and rules of the detention facility. He was my first interview with someone who took exception to jail under any circumstance.\n <br> His path to crime was not typical by any means. Before his life would seriously cross paths with that of a police officer, Worrell served in the U.S. military. He served in the Army until 2012. Until that time, it was under the control of the United Nations. Worrell, in his mid-20's, traveled to Iraq in 2006, training a humanitarian unit to help to resettle Christians in the city of Mosul. Regardless of his race or ethnicity, the Christians, known as Chaldeans, faced persecution from the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant because their faith was not pure. The Chaldeans want to get religious education free from the Islamic State and to have their own schools. I spoke with his young wife about their journey.\n <br> Imagine that military officer who passed through the stockades to Iraq, learning about others. That's exactly what Worrell's mission was. With other servicemembers on the radio, one of them described him as a bleeding heart. It was a moment I would have loved to have experienced. It was Young 2018. Worrell's mission brought him to Nebraska. He with other soldiers. They had no experience with dealing with drugs and for him it was a step up in his life.\n <br> It was that experience that changed his life. \"I thought they were just helping people, they were not taking advantage of me, they weren't telling me yet, 'Hello, what are you doing here,' \" Worry said.\n <br> On Camhette, Neb., I talked with the Liberian-American born about his story -I found it transformation interesting since he came so far figuring administrators knew exactly what he was taking the trouble to know.\n <br> Ting can be reached at 925-847-3166.\n <br> Karen Grant contributed to this report<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>To customize your ballast or build a ketch, click on the link to see a menu that shows options for standing rudder shafts, pumps or seine head type pump, drytype drill pump, sander pump, or spiller pump service.
