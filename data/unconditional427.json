(Photo: John Minchillo, AP)\n <br> WASHINGTON \u2014 The Environmental Protection Agency is ramping up its roadshow of welcome signs to state officials, offering them opportunities to participate in clean air projects under an emerging program that will provide grants for creating or preserving green air legislation.\n <br> The opportunity contracts, signed last year in the office of New York Secretary of State William Galvin, are conducted through the Office of Air and Radiation. The EPA is also awarded more than $3 million from a $100 million federal grant from 2007 to 2008 to continue pursuing air pollution rules to implement the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's sweeping climate change policy, Dodd-Frank.\n <br> The program officially started in late February with a slate of events in 24 states. Later in the month, the EPA held the next round of events, which will include discussions among government officials and industry executives.\n <br> Among the topics to be discussed: enforcement actions the agency is taking against polluters, the value of the EPA's programs to public health, and how best to mitigate the impacts associated with pollution, said OAR Administrator Julie Praz, speaking at an air pollution conference this month in Washington. She now is enjoying \"unprecedented levels of bipartisan support\" as Obama promotes regulations expected to dramatically reduce smog.\n <br> Meanwhile, a Senate report Monday asserted the EPA has largely provided intelligence on large polluters, contributing to breathless coverage from government and most notably, pro-coal, fearmongering websites.\n <br> \"The federal government should be helping states to implement air quality standards, but instead seems intent on propagating the falsehoods that lead people to believe EPA is a threat to their rights to air,\" Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., the top Republican on the Senate's environment committee, said in a statement.\n <br> EPA officials insist the program was an oversight of an outside office that \"failed to take into account the potential effect\" air pollution regulations would have on states. \"The program was needed based on the mounting evidence of an increasing number of air quality and health impacts stemming from dangerous air pollution,\" EPA spokeswoman Jenifer Nash said last week.\n <br> Others disagree, noting that the EPA selected particularly vulnerable states and cities that have suffered from tailpipe pollution \u2014 air linked to heart disease, strokes and respiratory cancer.\n <br> \"We really think it's a very heavy handed approach for the EPA to be taking consistently and bit by bit for every state,\" said Carolyn Bartlett, a managing partner of Weir Canfield Fay & Dorr LLP who manages corporations and civil litigation.\n <br> Argie Cushman, former executive director of the Texas Air Pollution Control District, cautioned against seeing the EPA as a positive policy actor in an era of international climate change negotiations. \"It's deeply troubling that the EPA seeks to strengthen its reputation for recklessness and corruption,\" he said in an email.\n <br> Officials in states meeting with the EPA this month say EPA officials told such challenges under the agency's Clean Air Act, which allows the EPA to set rules limiting emissions, are voluntary.\n <br> \"Our energy program is not a gift from EPA to states,\" said Rick Cole, CEO and president of the Colorado\n <br>"}
