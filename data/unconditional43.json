{"output": "NEW DELHI: Foreign investors in India will be allowed to convert stocks or chests of gold into non-cash items doing not constitute \"risky\" financial instruments under the new law aimed at discouraging short-term hedging among investors eyeing risky stocks as part of the bull call on all-time highs in the rupee .Another flexibility to be allowed is allowing the convertibility of foreign securities into various other currency without restriction.STF \"Guardians of Financial Stability\" bill, which includes cancellation of foreign investments and anti evading fomentators, comes into force on Sept 3.It is designed to \"protect the interests of foreign investors,\" finance minister P Chidambaram said.Foreign investors will be allowed to transfer funds as non-secure transmission for non-current transactions irrespective of description.The government has listed a number of narrow exceptions covering assets such as currency of countries for which UPA had imposed sanctions, including the KR4 billion (over Rs 644 crore) that came through payments routed through China and a Gujarati-language newspaper, stating that there were non-suspect reasons for it.For riskier investments, they will be allowed to convert insanely high valuations to partial Certain Axes (QAS) (Non-collateralized Debt Obligations).These are non-transparent transactions but they are sought at the request of non-performing borrowers, who seek to transfer huge amounts of risk to them after rising domestic prices and deteriorating interest incidence since 2010.SaveRs100 million, the proposed allowance is not enough to meet the proposed turnover of Rs 6,610 crore, according to industry estimates.Investors can also transfer KYC/AML details and transfer mobile subscription number to other services such as value-added tax . Therefore, investors besides traders are also allowed to transfer real estate or other assets, according to a document sent to CIVIBANK shareholders on Thursday.The limit for value-added tax is Rs 1 crore for any person.Taking account of the buyer's quantum of acquisition over which QAS has been granted, the limit for value-added tax varies between Rs 1 and Rs 4 lakh depending on the specific transaction offered by the purchaser. The new mechanism would discourage \"exploiting buyers who have bite in many obituaries of asset prices but have mediocrity in techie usability\", the government has said.Foreign investors after early deadlines can file after a year to dispose of their money instead of just transferring it earlier to avoid the new registration requirement for such transaction.Under this provision, delivery of goods or services by a receiver for a foreign investor might be registered within three to four weeks.Delaying registration directly to avoid the QAS registration would also encourage foreign investment by those who prefer smooth registry of similar transactions in India, a government official said.\"It does not preclude dealers to register close to foreign investors. It is primarily for the regulator to act on on complaints from investors with regards to lack of sophistication and lack of products,\" said one of the officials who did not want to be identified.The information handling capability has been strengthened by extending the period for submitting investors' requests for verification from one year to three months from the date of notification.So instead of QAS reservation being more stringent than the other insurance products, it is more relaxed. But, the finance minister said, it was originally intended to give a margin of error.The definition of paper market also has been given a makeover.\"The earlier definition of \"paper market\" cannot be used unless there is an actual boiler as such market is fixed or calculated,\" Chidambaram had said.SBI , Trai and State Bank of India said they are in favour of increased monitoring by RBI of the market by, in effect, movement of currency in physical and virtual form.For exchanges, the new law requires their registration.Living on Mahatma Gandhi's famous coolie creed : \"For each100,000 khode ekata jaam (100,000 pounds of Exile), there pains a100 nurses.
