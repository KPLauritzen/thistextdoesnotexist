{"output": "On Tuesday the House of Representatives considered a bill to repeal food stamps altogether. According to the Associated Press, out of the 235 House members who voted to pass the bill, only 29 supported the bill from then-chairman of the House Energy Subcommittee, Rep. Fred Upton (R \u2013 MI).\n <br> But if the agency responded in kind to the AP report, then still only one person would lose SNAP benefits\u2026 Gov. Sam Brownback, who has admitted that he has no desire to be governor, and would rather rather spend his time serving the state of Kansas than promote his own agenda.\n <br> The budget-busting measure rushed through the House's Transportation Committee in a shocking, last-minute move without hearings. Rep. Harold Rogers (R \u2013 KY) told the AP that the staff to analyze the bill \"brought in those who have no experience in handling policy.\" Food stamps, which operates under the Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, was granted its original expiration in February of this year.\n <br> Ironically, Rep. Fred Upton (R \u2013 MI) himself unveiled a proposed budget that would reduce or eliminate $350 million in improved nutrition assistance program reimbursements to 42 of the 50 states. If some of these states reduced or eliminated this critical funding, it would be extremely difficult for them to afford food stamps like Governor Brownback. This is how Brownback justifies his proposed cuts, and it is.\n <br> Since 2011, Kansas has slashed its SNAP benefits and costs per eligible household by 37 percent. House Speaker Ray Merrick (R-KS) and Gov. Brownback both can't take credit for eliminating food stamps; the governor only approved $61 million in funding.\n <br> In response to the news that the food stamp restorationist being pursued by the House will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in sleazy business transactions, the fraud would increase by $80 million a year, Carrie Emmons reports.\n <br> In December, Merrick sent a letter to Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley, whose predecessor also slashed funds and benefits. Auburn State University President Dr. Cuonzo Martin praised the incoming Republican governor in a letter:\n <br> \"I happen to follow the debate on food stamp programs in the context of Governor Bentley's proposal to cut the state's state budget going into FY 2015. Yet you have your own plan scheduled for approval next month\u2026 Auburn has pledged not to reduce benefits\u2026 which just happened to be eliminated in Louisiana. I know that you are following Louisiana politics, but nearly all of the 71 Governmental Investment Boards in Alabama are controlled by state employees appointed by the Governor. The beauty of these boards is that they have remained untouched since they were established in 1957. So, since money goes beyond the first budget in January, our recent rebates to corporate food service companies are simply picking up your money. This is yet another reason that our universities will not take an axe to state employee retirement benefits.\"\n <br> Texas Republican State Senator Dan Patrick, likewise, has repeatedly used his rhetorical performances to tout cuts in Food Stamps\u2014a laughable effort at solace to Catholic income security programs even Mormon fiscal policies.\n <br> As the Houston Chronicle's John Coy team notes, there is a mechanism in the farm bill stipulating that the expiration of federal payments to states need not come as a sweet welcome to senators who draft chicanery for personal gain:\n <br> For the prior three years, the Senate's farm bill, passed by a voice vote, was amended to include provisions benefiting fiscal policy at individual farms and food safety and waste management programs. But Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, made it explicit that she intended the food phaseout to get farm bill votes, not to end them.\n <br> If you want to see how Labor Agencies use campaign finances to expand their influence over working people, this is a good case study.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Cloth\n <br> To make the cloth, take a piece of cloth about 2m x 6m long and rub a small amount of the wax of the beeswax into it. Do this near or over a fire, and the cloth will strip off wax in seconds.\n <br> Next take a flower aroud the appropriate size, cut it into quarters, and rub the wax into it, oversaturate to a depth and bending behind a pin, according to the clip above.\n <br> Flower storage is time-consuming and and very messy, so be leary of storing them in the same monstrous heap of corps unfortunately raising. this is how a very thorough and to \"onion thorn blossom\" round vase took form.\n <br> And later:\n <br> In the late past the USA had a rough and ready method of preserving fluids, seen in bottles however old those bottles may have become. The bees wax being the closest fluid substitute, the wax bottles were designated for the purpose: this would help pass from one stable area of civilisation to another since flammables could easily be carried away, given that the wax or oil wasn't too thick,\n <br>"}
