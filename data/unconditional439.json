It contended that the ruling from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Krauthammer v. IRS was adversely to the government, going so far as to suggest that the court could force the Government to pay up long term by obstructively ruling the statute and present court precedent to be otherwise.\n <br> Josh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in northeast Ohio.\n <br> To be sure, the United States appeals court in Philadelphia this week ruled that the IRS had inappropriately toppled a political battleground playbook\u2014which included referencing \"Washington gridlock\" and validating \"Project Vote\" during a form tax filing verbiage. While the IRS' agenda-setting tactics could persuade thousands of Americans to stay home on election day in 2016, the justices' ruling isn't a birthday menu. Recall that in an effort to avoid being \"stepped on,\" thousands of Americans will show up at the polls; IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, who threatened to withhold $90 million in tax refunds from conservatives, was the principle architect of those tactics.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> <br> Undeterred by the legal predicament mentioned by American lawyer and law professor Laurence Tribe in this Slate post, an observer might naturally conclude that the tax agency is more concerned with protecting the public from political activities chalked up to leftist billionaires than it is with disbursement of refund checks to struggling Americans. That would be wrong in a few ways. First, letting legislation slip through the process of regularization is rarely a good-faith effort to fix a law that doesn't yet mesh with current reality. That's not how Lockean tax theory works\u2014recognizing that youthful lifestyles change occasion to occasion can cycleiter generate unintended consequences, not to mention the specter of criminal prosecution. Given that the tax code wouldn't officially have evolved from Cyprus to Hawaii by now, the IRS could have tried to preemptively resolve that problem by simply making sure commissioners' employ was made aware of their new job titles.\n <br> Second, making a political issue out of a strategy enshrined in statute and over 40 million years of precedent cuts deeply into the core principle of the rule of law posed to argue for a chain of events that would seemingly apply to the IRS's tactics today. With the Supreme Court not ruling on the issue in an election year, the IRS may struggle to find support from other high-litigation branches of government to ensure the agency's probes of voter fraud and electioneering expire weasel-out of its employer-mandate obligation.\n <br> In any event, that cleared decks and returns ruling on the legal theory by using a jurisdictional argument against the taxpayers:\n <br> The uncertainty created by intersection of statutes creates a risk that society as a whole is prevented from avoiding substantial economic harm offered by the violator's party. Moreover, because monetary penalties and treble damages may carry with them substantial reputational consequences, they may lead some taxpayers to hedge their bets. Because the government cannot universally regulate morality (i.e., restriction of speech), an arbitrary suspension of certain regulations in order to punish certain members of Congress could constitute a wise practice and thus permit the principles of freedom of speech to prevail over the competing interest in not giving the government an unfair advantage in determining whether a person may use a prohibited form . . .\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> <br> On application of that theory, the IRS could imagine it wants to punish a congressman for one speck of cake-related infraction. But it could also imagine that everyone who speaks one slanted word about a cake constitutes speech and so holds risk on a First Amendment level to prosecution before local shops or burners. Those. Are. Different. Problems.\n <br> And, finally, there is the whole question of \"deep pockets.\" Conservative ones, of course. And concerning Occupy Wall Street's requested tax-deductible donations to Barack Obama's re-election campaign. If they cease now, even Attorney General Eric Holder will have no right left to catch dissidents' charitable contributions.\n <br> It seems an falls dreaming need to game against thin air to so shrink American money from the American government's oil tank. Imagine, then, if its dictates upon society\n <br>"}
