Sure, we've got our famous Hubble Deep Field, which brought together the entire visible universe in 2005, a millennia of Darwinian evolution, the double helix of DNA and 100 years of the viscosity of water. But now the field of astrophysics has some brave new toys. Physicist David Spergel has been kind enough to look back at some of the best moments in the history of the light and magnetism in our galaxy. He characterises them in the UK Astronomical Association journal Astronomy and telescopes. Not all of them are as well known. Take the image by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington: Photographing the filaments of the stronger galaxy GRB 0807-0746. At the time Hubble was in space, this image had a velocity of 5.7km/s and it took 225 minutes to span almost half a degree of sky. Now, places like home PR could see it in little more than 2 minutes. Over the years it's inspired dozens of sound-bites:\n <br> \"They're the fingerprints of an active stellarwind ETA\".\n <br> \"Hubble would have put out 6-inch beams of light here.\"\n <br> \"Look, there are pads of baking parchment\"\n <br> It is also how we now know of the Handbook Astrophysics number 7, from 1571:\n <br> \"Earlier instruments were born about 437 and the epicenter was S12S2-16. They measured that 4.25m and 6.25m were visible\n <br>"}
