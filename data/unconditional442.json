{"output": "By Ashley Howard\n <br> @AshtonHoward\n <br> Melania Trump's beautiful mansion President Donald Trump's New York address This source has told us that without Melania's speech at the RNC, it's near certain she won't even be on the first prime-time debate. The New York Times discovered out that as of May 12, Trump and Steve Bannon were still trying to save a tax plan benefiting the top 1%, even though that one initiative was a clear failure. Presumably, they'll argue the same thing about the Keystone XL Pipeline being \"one of Hillary's greatest accomplishments and, one hopes, one of Barack's if he is elected.\" Tossing campaigns under the bus in favor of securing key cabinet positions is completely acceptable to Donald Trump and does not look exactly like a conviction. We can safely assume he thinks he's delusional. \"He has a narcissist's belief,\" a former campaign adviser told New York Magazine. \"His biggest mistake was when he thought he could take on the establishment and win.\" Sadly, we've already seen an effective demonstration of that narcissist's belief. American democracy is deeply fractured, and in 2017, it seems capable of little except accepting as passable a president who is a sworn political stranger to half the country. His name is Donald Trump.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Those in Congress need to get to do some real work. This week's focus is the Chronic Trauma of Firefighters and with its recent one of its share of tragedies that have caused towns and cities to close fire stations. The first fire in Enid, Oklahoma was on April 24, 1974 in the town of Enid in unremarkable Smith County where Anchor had overhead a warning shot resounding all across the town. With 1,100 people dying in the tornado that followed, Enid's fire ravaged and burned for eight months. As the 22 pages of documents released to The Enid News recently released, it becomes now easier to understand why the town's residents voted a generation later to kill the fire stations back in 1997. So what happened and when did the Enid Fire Fighters Union give in to racism?\n <br> In 1980's. when Enid's Mayor Frank Burns sought approval of a plan to construct a new fire station in a space currently occupied by an elementary school the union, conducting what will be confirmed as racial cleansing, along with Burns, fought the plan saying it was against the union's values.\n <br> \"My union did everything in its power from that point on to throw our union into the gutters to give the vote to the white workers at these undertows,\" said Bob Swanson, former President of the union. \"No, I fucking did.\"\n <br> In perpetual conflict with Mayor Burns Captain Mint not only opposed this or any under built firehouse but stated that efforts were clashed in Enid are instead taking inches off property for private use or subdivision zoning. This further strained relations in an already strained community.\n <br> In 1983 Sam Walker, the USA Chief Fire Officer testified on for the Committee Hearing under oath that compa\u00f1eros denied a membership to persons whose honor he knew was worth more than most of the members of the Chattanooga his fire station had compensated in its attempts to train emigres.\"That position among emigres has leads to some very strange scenarios that I wouldn't be a third generation fireman in this town if I did not raise my voice against,\" said Walker.\n <br> Because Enid lacked a fire men's retirement program most of the volunteers left but with the fire station mothballed the local pension brought in the contributions needed to bring in its number a smaller fire fighters union, as part of its struggle with Orr, the Dixie Nursing Association, and other captive unions the union signed a federal settlement agreement on provisions of their liability insurance the contract was as follows: \"If after one year(18 months) of stopping hostilities Loyal Shepherd County Fire Protection Bird Mountain Fire Company shall have remained unrepresented in fighting any fire, the company shall indemnify the Union for the out of pocket costs of the Union's own and other volunteers performing work involving medical assistance(front line medical assistance) or rendering justification for treating persons injured restrengthened their idea of risking their property and the Union's life for anyone. \"\n <br> Now that the hard fought victories of the Revolutionary War, Civil War, Civil Rights Movement and the Civil Rights Act and Constitution are firmly in grasp of achieving their eternal goal progressive bootleggers of all colors, genders and extents have turned to exploiting and profiting from the patriotically and honorably fought sacrifices back during and after the United States of America's early years. Unfortunately it seems many of those men, women and children that stepped forth into mortal danger for their country making them coldly conscious of them only took an action to great reward to be shoveling manure and desolately stinking flies with their own bare hands have become accustomed to danger as if it comes like fact to break their chains from voting balloting en masse to fight against it. When our country is safe in the hands of the demagogues\n <br>"}
