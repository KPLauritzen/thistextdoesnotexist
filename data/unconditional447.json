{"output": "<br> Yesterday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released some troubling facts concerning water pollution in the United States. From 2009 through 2012, sewage overflows into rivers and lakes at alarming rates -- ending up in the Great Lakes, Epicencinch Creek and the Animas River. From 2010 through 2013, wastewater leaked into the river near Albuquerque due to a flatbed truck release in the town of Devil's Lake. This event happens at a rate of almost 4 million gallons once per year. Per the report, \"At least three more transmission more than 6,400 feet long or smaller, or a total of 381 large pipe breaks involving inactive TPW's\u2033CA overall, were reported from other states of CO, NV, CO, NM, and SD during the same time. In Northeast PA, West Virginia and TN, nearly 400 unique from 2011-2012.\n <br> According to EPA data, in November 2009, more than a billion gallons of diesel and gasoline spilled into the Animas River. In response, the EPA ordered the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to stop issuing certificates of compliance (COI) to oil and gas \"pipeline operators\" during October 2013 and March 2014. CDPHE has finished up their respective COI review process. Numerous new COI violations have been documented since then. If these new incidents continue, then we wonder how long it will take\u200b\u200b ???\n <br> Now consider Morris intake expressed as a percentage of Total Liquid Discharge. In 2013, it increased from 21,774,017 to 22,366,623. This is a 110% increase from an almost zero intake during the beginning of the new millennium. The numbers look nearly amazing, right? Not when you take a look at the pattern.\n <br> Morris backflows displace and find its way into the Beaufort, a clear part of the Beaufort Sea that separates Beaufort and Chukchi archipelagos from Kodiak and Baker islands. The Spud Island cooling tower runs through a three mile stretch from the Northwest fork of the Severn River north, past Inlet No. 1 to PIT 110 where it terminates. ---------------------------------------------- Axes of A1 are nearly lined with significant amounts of Potomac stalk. The vortex is 11 hours 31 minutes south\u00a0> 53 deg 07 min\u00a0> 911 ft 08 min > 341 ft 12 min\n <br> The Google Earth image shows both the Beaufort slow starting dam and road out from it.\n <br> The Spud Island cooling tower is also marked on Google Earth; and even with none of the major draw backs of steam injection \u2013 shown here \u2013 power generation is still feasible.\n <br> Morris need not raise this troublesome issue itself. Simply establishing better data collection could be done with proper drilling of boreholes and more persistent monitoring.
