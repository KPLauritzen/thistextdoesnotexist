If get enough of your lies I dont think many people take it seriously, but that is not very different from anything else. Some people really want to be called a bigshot. There are a small minority of them who dosen't even want to be called that, and the rest would so care about whatever label they were given. No matter what, self-proclaimed incels talk crap like you (and I) always expect its going to stop one day. It doesnt, not...that either.\n <br> <br> Take this blog as an example. It was created as a joke between two friends who had fought already last year over who would be the better lover... one of them is only 20-something and claims to be with 7 women right now, and \"was told by girls to be with the older ones\" (so either no pussy here, or he simply cant meet them all.) I'm sure 98% of the people here are just sharing their own stories. Like you read over your latest \"meet and make love with a girl\" concoction that went horribly wrong. Five years from now you'll look back at this shit and laugh, \"What a loser, he didnt even realize he had two balls!\"\n <br> <br> Put your faith in a couple of attractive girls to start your game with, and be grateful that you have even tried at all with women in the first place. Even if you got your foot in the door, your chances are pretty low of making any sort of progress with any face. Hunky guys can fuck any girls with pretty much impunity provided they are competent enough. Your best chance for success in terms of actual sex is to not have any confidence whatsoever with women - just because a girl liked you once and offers a blowjob every now and then, it doesnt mean it will like you back for long if a sober dragon drowns it in/fucks it clean. You dont know shit about relationships and your reservations and fears and insecurities will only have a short shelf life. You need to be dreaming of officially placed in the wing beyond Bellyache Lane, where the doubts and tits drop look and the deft lips turn you inert until the taxi arrives at your doorstep. The last chance to pull that off will be with a girl who really aspires to be with non-alpha guys. Get that girl to drop her pants for you with that very real expectation and she is de facto going to settle down by the time you come to realize you can make her smile for longer than a couple button pushes.\n <br> <br> Honestly, the best thing you can do is to meditate on the fact that there will be no SEX for you anyway. It is as simple as that. Natural selection favored those that had *real* convictions about sex, and you wont find a higher percentage of girls that really want to please you by being your strutting smarm doll or height luck for wanking vacantly while her throat is being held open by a parasitic clubby dude. In fact never trust guys you talk to about this stuff. They have absolutely OBSESSED on how women parent their children, and are always goin on about it. Seriously.\n <br> <br> Perception is EVERYTHING. Most guys claim to love cunnilingus when they actually suck dick moist enough to....vagina? Nah.
