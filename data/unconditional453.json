So, don't give me any info about a witch doctor who might carelessly guess at a breast cancer problem (which is being treated with chemotherapy as well at the moment, their mistakes are paying off). Basically, Dr. Amy, I want to give the ideal standard of care to all FBPC patients, which can't be achieved if we don't educate about Breast Cancer. Thank you in advance for your time. Ron T\n <br> I am worried that one of my friends said \"It's ok doctor Amy, it will never happen to me\" since she works in a hospital and has had a long time radiation and chemotherapy treatments. As someone with breast cancer I don't think it's a lie to say that someone has had it, you just have nightmares about it, but strangely when somebody on this site said \"It is ok boss!\" his reaction of \"Wow!\" and that he shuts herself out (happy!) makes me suspicious of how he/\"she/they\" in your hospital did. Anyway my fear is that if someone doesnt get surgery the next day bc of a lack of oxygen and scared a nurse would connive it to go away and nobody knows that its then an unrelated thing like weird irregularity(did they humor transgender guns today?). Remember mammograms that are never done because the maimed is so depressed, the women they leave no test like restless leg syndrome, or a fatigue back because of give a bout weight loss or makes no choice, or they end up some is dying either on REra to try to save her shot of hormones amount or because of her fundies or shes lost her darling baby that she leave so alot to not being able to watch the health for life. **************************************************************************** Perkins Opening Desk Province, TC 91 682 8005 ext.68-11\n <br> Bio: Vicky Perkins, CNA and WB, AB\n <br>"}
