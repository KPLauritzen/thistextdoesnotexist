{"output": "Ruby Hart as Marion 1\n <br> I have a new favorite Salt Lake City women's soccer match. And you probably know why.\n <br> Ruby Hart saved what was basically the game in the 54th minute Saturday afternoon. Hart, once again, wasn't surrounded by her fellow midfielders. Instead she moved between the channels, fielded shots from the outside and was inches away from tipping over a cross with little to no effort.\n <br> That's a solo assist. When your team is looking to create a late breakthrough in the game, you will steal a goal when needed most.\n <br> Unfortunately, that might've been the difference. The Saint Louis FC (7-0-4) trailed 1-0 after 30 minutes until a goal from Lynn Williams. The goal was on the league's PDL Team of the Week and took an uncharacteristic United States team to the next level.\n <br> United States not showing up\n <br> The United States women have been down on form this tournament. On the heels of a 1-0 loss to France on Friday night, they didn't control at even strength against a Saint Louis team out going for a goal and win.\n <br> The USA only managed to put its four shots on goal in the first 15 minutes.\n <br> On the bright side of the disappointing beginnings the U.S did manage to really use its pace. Wambach was praised for her speed Monday morning by U.S. coach Jill Ellis. That was evident against the Hammers, though it currently does not effect her game.\n <br> The United States is thus far having its worst tournament of the modern era when it comes to its ability to put a shot on target.\n <br> Harkes was shocked to see the team struggling in fitness and trailing so far behind after their end of last play.\n <br> \"We need to take a bunch of training days to get some heart into it next week. We're still in first place with 10 games to go, so it's not a huge deal. But for us, we've gotten pretty low. They were good on Friday but we haven't lost all year and we have really deserved to win a game in here.\n <br> \"We have had some really good wins. There are two more this week.\"\n <br> The Red Stars' not-so-good record\n <br> From a political standpoint, it was unfortunate that the United States didn't get that much production out of their top two midfielders. You can't win games based of position when one of them on the field is post game suspended.\n <br> Knowing what the stats said, Tranmere de Visser (2-6-1) should've at least won the ball right back from Maria Gonzalez in the heavy denial. She's been solid in that role.\n <br> Stefan Hurwitz, on the other hand, didn't fare all that well. The then of first year club Morgantown (WVU) suffered an injury in the second half that sidelined him with a torn ACL. Considering he's the left-sided defensive midfielder controlling the center, that was big news to much of the announcing audience Saturday.\n <br> On the bright side, the Red Stars are actually the second youngest team in the women's league. The minutes have accordingly begun to trust veteran goalkeeper \"Jenny\" Nichols into a more prominent role, including handling key fouls.\n <br> Qualifying to USA 2016\n <br> The top teams in the tournament still get to participate in the 2016 Olympics to be held in Russia to replace those from 2015.\n <br> \"It's absolutely a great experience. It's also a tough cup and you don't know what's going to happen,\" Red Stars head coach Rory Dames said afterward. \"What I'm looking for now is to a) get the players back around. Finally get some bonding. Almost had a winning spirit going into the games against Seattle without playing each other. We're eager going into Toronto without seeing each other. It's a difficult one in my opinion, but try to go into this with a sense of one practiced standard. Here in Vancouver, we're different. We do have some of our depth back and it's going to be a battle for a top spot in the women's league.\"\n <br> Want more history?

There are souls that are in step with the rave movement and the computer generated visuals.\n <br> 'retro' is a wonderful word to have. That's one of the reasons why it resonates so well with me. It's very energizing and real enough to have taken over the word.\n <br> Notice how the women's bodies all have a retro look to them and women's testicles\n <br>"}
