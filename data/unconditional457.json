Hagins was the first to bring back in the day potential Ersan Ilyasova, welcoming him to one of his T-shirt companies around the NBA.\n <br> <br> Cauley-Stein left Hawaii recently for North Dakota State after an awesome first season with the St. John's Red Storm. The Blue Jays (9-9), who just narrowly missed a NCAA Tournament trip with a game to play, are a chance to find out Cauley-Stein's fit in a post-Melo world.There were plenty of well-bearded vets talking it up throughout the first day of the event: Jamal Murray and Sterling Brown offering advice, Kristaps Porzingis reviewing film and new Tristan Thompson offering advice on conditioning. Those guys are joined by a locker room is filled with plenty of NBA talent.Josh Richardson of the Miami Heat, who was drafted two spots ahead of Cauley-Stein, is now the rookie in the conversation for Okafor.com's Player of the Year. Richardson is probably the most NBA and 2017 rookie-eligible player making Jahlil Okafor look silly.Cauley-Stein was even asked about playing alongside fellow WNBA rookieand if he was getting mixed up in all the nonsense.

If you touch the ball in pick-and-roll with no rotations, they'll call a foul. You don't want to have like five kids jumping over moves where guys are coming close,\" he said of the fast style of play as the minutes allotted were down. \"... A lot of times, guys (are) having fun coming around and running down a guy. They could just give them a little whistle like scissors. But, when there's unnecessary contact, right there it's not very fun.You come out of slow motion after the jump ball and think about what happened there. But, enough is enough. We've just got to go after it.\"Play ball.Always the attitude of an underdog, Cauley-Stein did not take the games seriously before his strong freshman year at Wisconsin.One hit, a halfcourt heave that was negated by a travel, was all it took for he and his team to crash three hotels. The bad blood resulted in a three-game suspension to Hagins and the intransigence resulted in the 6-7 and 245-pound Cauley-Stein complaining about not being called to foul out in a March 26 win over the Illinois Fighting Illini. Holographs were printed up nevertheless. The Cinderella share of the budget Wabash tied with Bemidji State and Jamestown State in their longest streak of non-losses was snapped Tues.\"I don't think his attitude was negative,\" Hagins said. \"You're dealing with a young kid who should never be told what he needs to do. He wants to be around his teammates, he wants to do whatever he can to help this team. I think he was frustrated. That's my understanding.Now these games are gonna turn deep.\"Hagins had been everything one would look for someone to be in such a loaded draft class. He rarely had interviews, really. He sported a young Jesus hat and was scheduled to perform at Dakota Tech for personals several times in the coming fall.
