In many parts of the country, including states like Michigan and Pennsylvania, it often comes as a surprise to students who aren't getting an automatic pay bump after years of impressive quality of education. While the change in minimum wage has caused some cancellations on renewal contracts at many schools, many of those students aren't blatantly benefiting from it. In ultra-expensive needs-based districts, support from taxpayers of these students who aren't getting a bump has been growing.\n <br> It's important to note that education funding doesn't happen according to what we as students received in our tuition bills. Those pools and savings funds exist, as do the cash reserves maintained by school districts. And educators pay some students' expenses like per diems, gas, and school supplies out of those pools and savings in varying degrees.\n <br> While schools all over the country have been pulling back on some of their academic subjects and consulting it as a reason to keep entering a class or three, it appears that traditional funders have also seen a need to boost benefits and raise the minimum wage. But schools that are already strapped for funds will most likely continue to work to save spending elsewhere. A low tuition has been a major luxury for many schools, which will take some creative financial planning to ensure their lowest population rates still meet the amount of spending needed to provide a high degree of education for students in a sustainable fashion.\n <br> Education Spending Alternatives Really Compelling\n <br> Instead of the more traditional, immediate revenue cuts that governing boards in states such as Michigan are taking, areas like Detroit are more likely to increase a number of college programs and vocational instruction services beginning at the high school level, if only for a short period. Doing so will save schools and individual students in the long run in the money and labor necessary to maintain this level of education.\n <br> Also, where compulsory programs such as pre-k are struggling financially, auxiliary programs will arise to provide similar time frames and professional test preparation while making up for some of the costs of basic curriculum updates.\n <br> Not only can educators look around and see their schools are lavishing even more dollars on student services, educators can also look around and see that many university courses are only affordable about half of what students pay at their community colleges, which comes out to two grand a sitting at U-M \u2013 or an outlay of $1,542 a year per student, or around $24,000 a year per student. Resources like those enough for students who might walk out of school for cash, and then have a devastatingly expensive second thing to worry about, what with these factors that probably feel limited or meaningless.\n <br> It's all connected, though, if we extend the same listening and pouring of resources\n <br>"}
