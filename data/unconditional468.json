The Church has an outstanding teaching on the higher moral level one should strive after, a teaching known as The Golden Rule, whose teachings were imported into the way early Christian saints tended to be. Earlier Jews and Muslims also taught high moral ambitions, and indeed, during the horror of World War II, it was the British government that actually did most of the of the heavy lifting to help Jews to avoid certain death at the hands of the Nazis. The Jews who survived were, once again, the most moral and the best citizens of their nations, exemplars of \"kindly compassion and kind treatment\" (see the Hillel lectures by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks of the University of Chicago which \"describe this remarkable unselfishness in masterful detail\"). If Erickson's critic had read a more recent Jewish conservative religious essay by Mandeep Mandelbrot (http://mermandb.org/mandelbrot-thes-moral-realities-of-empty-towers/) and by Judah Magnes (http://www.jewishvirtuehub.com/2011/11/30/will-geberg-set-live-without-apologizing-for-himself/) like his \"If Israelis join Golda Meir's illegal vision of Zionism and 'conquer' Palestine, there will be nothing or NOONE to prevent ISIS\u2026 an existential threat to the entire Western World from here on in'\" also on Casey Research...\n <br> The title I preferred was\n <br> \"Do you want to join Golda Meir in an hour of madness?
