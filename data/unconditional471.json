{"output": "Childhood - Carmen Dobrak presents interviews and testaments by those who participated in the Revolutionary Youth Movement of Turkey and its victorious exile.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>This month, Russia has announced the death of Holy Father John Paul II. Relatives of the pontiff, including his brother, Pope Paul VI, are reportedly asking that all religious services not be held in Latin unless the Vatican authorizes them. While there've been some clashes in the past, most notably a prioress d\u00e9marche during the papacy of John XXIII, this unilateral action by Russia is a dramatic escalation in the aggressive behavior of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n <br> The Pope's successor was known for being competitive and hard to get along with, a trait that was reinforced by his highly unorthodox style on global affairs and shrewd grasp of public opinion. Lounges from Vatican City opened over the years, but most were locked by the Russia emoluments, or \"Russian taxes\". Then in 2000, a new law was enacted forcing Vatican banks to move money on international markets to a Moscow institution which they did not want. This was an international sanction against the Pope visiting Russia. Moreover, the pope was also under scrutiny for related offshore companies during the investigations that started in the early 2000s.\n <br> The Russian protests to the Pope were over two stances: in 2005 the new priest was revealed to be the father of a pre-schooler (who was born after his marriage) and another man, together duting illegitimate children whose birth was probed by Italian prosecutors. Although the Vatican had declared the women innocent and took no action, the relevant antiterrorism units from Vatican City were poised for a crackdown on in-born, Americanizing Russians. Still, when Cardinal Ramon Lachman was proposed as the new Apostolic Nuncio to Russia, the Vatican said it was willing to consider his nomination on another condition:: that he publicly announce that the Pope remained \"a Roman-Catholic in all his spiritual aspects, including apostolic succession\".\n <br> Lachman did so, but after failing to change the Russian president's mind, is believed to have demanded that a Christmas Mass in Moscow be held in Russian unless the Vatican approved such a celebration in Farsi. Naturally, Russia vetoed the American's idea. This provoked a significant diplomatic clash with the United States led by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and political defections from Primate Albano Vallejo Vieira, one of Lachman's Vatican biostate attendants, and Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, one of Lachman's biostate attendants.\n <br> In the ensuing meeting between Grande Russie and Peace Corps-style, the two set the tone as expected: instead the Cardinal insisted on Kurbanishating them, by having them sign a communion symbol made by Moscow. Amid grumbling, Ivanov bestowed an sesame bag on Lobauss (3), at which point Lachman exclaimed: \"Fool on horseback \u2013 shove your hand down your pants.\" The hostile reactions from both the Vatican and Russia culminated in Ivanov recompromising the prayer ritual in the desires of rigor idealo. Utrum Psalter, 'Master and Vice President of Russia leader', was rechristened \"The Peace Book\", to the consternation of the Russian delegation which is still demanding that the annual Roman Couplets Salutis be cancelled at the gates of St Paul's.\n <br> Finally, in a possible attempt to quell the war between Rome and the Empire, a lower level representative \"Under Secretary\" from Russia joined Lachman, the Curia, and Yaroslavl at a Holy Year's dinner. The ambassador even acknowledged Cardinal Coccopalmerio and his reply began with the words, \"Your Holinesss\" but this did nothing to ease tensions. Outwardly, these episodes of impasse led to an improved relationship with Russia with Vatican's president Jose Zavada hoping to \"improve the situation on the Sochi concession which is exploited by patriots'. 2\n <br> While the world observed Putin's deep diplomatic standoff against the Catholic church, the Polish priest denied the pontiff's thephyremata, saying that at the end of the day: \"he is still the successor of Saint Peter and the patriarch of Rome, a personality as unchangeable as the carbon atom, etc.\" A few around the world took the exclamation as a reliable warning however, such as Pope Benedict XVI who said: \"If it's true, perspectives are threads, there are no secrets, etc.\" Nonetheless, something is clearly wrong, which is detailed in this article on NikitasBolite.\n <br> Sources:\n <br> Russian media \u2013 RT tributes \u2013 Russian MoD Broadcasting \u2013 Amos If, Specialist, Revcasc\u00ednatos Putin, IpsosMedias, WORDS ON POLYEWONDS, die Vatican News, Agence France Presse, IIPRS, Rius Inversinis.\n <br> www.thepopeisgay.com.\n <br>"}
