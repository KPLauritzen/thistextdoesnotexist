So it is with great consternation that I now see reactions to plans for the Red Line extension to Wicker Park (and Loop); once again, administration hasn't heard the feedback from the community.\n <br> To wit: emails and chats and postings about the visioning meetings flooded lines and facebook pages and fed-ex use days. These\"citizen guardian projects\" at information booths with sunny tablet computers served more as a head-scratcher and shocker than any favorable balanced information.\n <br> Now I have to give credit: a public process ensued, at every step crucial willing like in a porn scene being discovered, otherwise had been seized with embarrassment and too few questions of procedures and tenure.

Parks superintendent Shelly Oscar-Kocher, City Comptroller Susana Mendoza, Alderman Christopher Cole, and Commissioner Austin Jones (an LPs stalwart and an immigrant from Salvadoran farmworkers collective wrongful arrest) all played a prominent role at celebrordom, only days short of coming together to recommend this crossing as a cradle for a greener Chicago.\n <br> But the Red Line work at numbers Thursday and Friday was a perverse quiz. Some of the projections were foolish, and learned nothing. Architect Navneet Suri got the numbers wrong for multiple Midwood stations, possibly as high as $500 million (belief in his big permits). Research was also done, questions were asked, and some delicately brought up that the\n <br>"}
