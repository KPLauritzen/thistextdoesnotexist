I hope they help us do the right and merciful thing and to let people know how the beauty and immeasurable kindness of God is perceived by all. Please read the full-text of both talks here. \"\u00a0----George Knepp\n George Knepp, 'Reflecting on the beauty and immeasurable kindness of God', Fort St. John, British Columbia - Fri Sept 28, 2012\n \"God has the direct ability to communicate with each and everyone. His Christian ministry not only touches people but expands love through faith.\" Time Magazine - May 4, 2011\n \"I'm strange. I'm weird. And I'm beautiful. At the height of his glorified ministry, Jesus Christ, the Son of God spoke these words of love and compassion: \"But you are beautiful; you are full of grace, love, and mercy!\"...\", 2 Thessalonians 1:5.\n The gifts that come from God for our repair are miraculous explanations for our limitations to excel in our station in life. There was a hermeneutics in the Old Testament that taught that God, the Son of God, was sent to reveal, interpret, and reveal God's defenses, from the face of the earth to the face of the highest heaven. In the New Testament or Christianity we are also brought into possession of this view, so that there can be no two views of God's power and dominant role.\u00a0\n God has means, purposes, and motive!\u00a0 It is not possible to reason without God's revelation of his plans and motives. Without God revelation no perspective or testimony may exist. God revealed himself to Jesus, the Lord ( Luke 1 & John) to the disciples, Paul, and the Reformers when they either traveled with him\u00a0 in person, or in some other world.\u00a0 \"God revealed himself to Jesus, the Lord, at his second coming . . . . And Paul's own personal experience of God at the Spirit/ light scale (see Unchanged Vision ) is enough to sell every ambition of every teacher and: 'The Lord gives water so that you drink.' ( Job 32:13 ) !\" (Irwin, Isaiah 14:20).\n Jesus chose to highlight the compassion and the beauty of God by using many examples to demonstrate that what he is talking about is by God:\n \"Blessed is the one who reads Isaiah. Blessed is the one who takes note of these words and makes them known! (Isaiah 45:1)\n In his experience of God's divine and limitless love and mercy he knew that we might share in his omnipotent and all powerful love if we and he would communicate with each other and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n God was not an God we saw. He was more real than this.\u00a0 \"I have said ,\" Sermon 22:10 From this he does know this . Indeed God r \"reveals himself\" to his Son\u00a0 Jesus ( Matthew 8:18 ) He has the power and fills people up, putting them in a position to experience gratitude to him. They are filled with the spirit of the gospel and the brilliant and eternally renewing light that surrounds the throne of peace .\u00a0\n He is give them a mountain of bread along with silver and gold and the gifts of the Spirit in their own seats .God provides joy and beauty, health and peace for them. So when Jesus was asked if he would go back and hate the one who had been seeking to kill him ( John 11:19-20, John 21:15-25 ), he responded, \" Whoever does not love has not been told the truth.\" When Jesus' first Son Calvary was put to death (Mark 15:42-43 ), the first-born Jesus, called by his apostles Peter and\n <br>"}
