(Photo: Michael Robinson Chavez, European Pressphoto Agency)\n <br> Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump settled on one foreign policy issue to become a flash point in the contest: whether the United States is \"going to stay in the Middle East.\"\n <br> Trump, who recently took the unconventional step of speaking from the convention floor, opened remarks to the delegates by discussing ISIS and Syria before quickly shifting gamely to his main topic.\n <br> \"I am not pointing guns at you,\" Trump said. \"Here's what I am saying. I am not saying to throw 18- and 19-year-olds out of the military. That's wrong. That's crazy. But we have to be far better than they are.\"\n <br> Trump had met privately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday to discuss the conflict in Syria. Netanyahu told reporters Trump was a \"good friend.\"\n <br> Trump, who has for decades advocated for reducing the number of U.S. troops in the Middle East, said to cheers that the United States should immediately increase resources for both tasks because ISIS has been hit with airstrikes.\n <br> \"If you think about the age of almost 90 percent of the changes in this Middle East, it's a result of Bush,\" Trump said. \"I understand this was done by Bush with an inordinate hatred of Islam. That hatred has to be broken out.\"\n <br> Other Republican party leaders vigorously opposed Trump's position \u2014 and he had to walk back from his position piece by piece in conversations with reporters after his speech.\n <br> Trump's vision for training Syrian rebels to retake the city of Raqqa, which the extremists captured, fell apart as he said. Each faction fighting ISIS sure has its own limitations, but Trump's aides had offered minimal specifics on what they would need, only asserting that U.S. trainers would need combat experience from Iraq and Lebanon to move forward. Other GOP candidates said Monday night that taking out ISIS requires coordinating with a nation\u00adstate that has either sanctioned or exported the group.\n <br> The readout from the Trump campaign made clear that it had sought meetings with bipartisan foreign policy groups such as the Union for Reform Judaism to develop its strategy. But it was unclear whether those efforts were successful.\n <br> Appearing before the American Israel Public Affairs Committee lobby committee in Washington on Tuesday, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said his opponents weren't concerned about protecting religious freedom in the Middle East because Saudi Arabia \"doesn't look at Jews and Christians the same way that Russia does, or China does.\"\n <br> Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states have pushed back against Trump's proposal, making his position about 14 million people in the region \"just really meaningless,\" Saudi Ambassador Adel al-Jubeir said after the AIPAC speech.\n <br> That broadside from the U.S.'s closest Arab allies underscored the challenge Trump faces in widening his appeal beyond his angry, white working-class base. Saudis, Egyptians and Lebanese had tepid responses after he had posed a question to questioners at a roundtable at the pan-Arab daily al-Hayat last month, about whether Muslims living in America should feel threatened. Although Trump has been well-received in the U.S. for days, some argued that his promise to build a wall to keep out undocumented workers would be anathema to Arabs.\n <br> Middle East experts surveyed by USA TODAY said their nations' views would become more worrisome if he continued to say bad things about Islam. \"Voters will hear it a lot more directly as candidates' positions become further defined,\" said Gabbard, who has been integrated into the campaign's policy and messaging.\n <br> Contributing: Elizabeth Weise\n <br> Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2h1vN2j<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>The University of California Berkeley School of Law acro\u00adpres\u00adsion increased to pertaining\u00ad to 23 SEC\u00adREC\u00adTS on Oct\u00adober 1st, 2011.\n <br> STEM DEVELOPMENT COR\u00adPORATION v.
