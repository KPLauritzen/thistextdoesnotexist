{"output": "Why you should learn jQuery (or JavaScript)\n <br> By Joseph\n <br> What is jQuery?\n <br> jQuery is the world's second most popular client-side programming language. Followed by \"HTML\", \"CSS\", and Ajax. jQuery is very highly regarded. Web developers rely on jQuery thanks to its flexibility and talent. This section helps you become able to write or customize your own internet applications with 'my' JavaScript.\n <br> jQuery Is Flexible\n <br> HTML is very rigid in its syntax, but jQuery isn't. With its combination with the DOM APIs (like jQuery.fn.bind() ), we can do a lot of pretty wild things with DOM manipulation. jQuery skips the single parameter parsing so it is very flexible. Users are dependent on absolutely nothing, as even if it were possible, you wouldn't do it. The jQuery framework is well documented, go to http://jquery.com to grab the source.\n <br> jQuery Is Highly Composable\n <br> jQuery is easily extensible and extendable. jQuery is built on top of the cross-plugin library jQueryUI instead of being an insular library. We'll be diving deeper into why and how to use similar plugins soon. But for now let us list some of the other abilities that the jQuery framework provides:\n <br> Quick selection with the mouse or arrow keys.\n <br> jQuery also handles custom mouse moves.\n <br> Preferences and auto-fetching.\n <br> Selecting the parent element in the DOM tree of an AngularJS or BackboneJS model.\n <br> Items displayed separately in lists using jQuery::each() .\n <br> . Support for most data formats (Document Object Model).\n <br> fetch\n <br> <br> jQuery.fn.contains\n <br> Clean and succinct for jQuery selectors.\n <br> jQuery implements all methods jQuery.fn.contains could offer.\n <br> Calculation of zeros and ones with JavaScript's Math.ceil() .\n <br> . Get and set DOM elements with jQuery specifically selected and implementation in jQueryUI -- this may apply to jQuery's argument on the document.\n <br> specifically selected and implementation in -- this may apply to jQuery's argument on the document. Create new DOM elements with jQuery object.\n <br> object. Get callbacks for function bindings.\n <br> callbacks for function bindings. Modify (append, subtract, multiply, divide, divide by zero, etc...).\n <br> (append, subtract, multiply, divide, divide by zero, etc...). Mobile-friendly.\n <br> jQuery UI\n <br> Develop feature-rich or plugin-free mobile experiences a la Backbone or Angular.\n <br> More example examples should be in the security section, but here are some to get you started.\n <br> Making the World a (Work) Easybook\n <br> When a new Interactive Object Model ( models.js ) is available, we should use that instead of building a new URL class. Enviroment.js, works great together with models.js .\n <br> Each JavaScript Joint-Product instance is mixed with one namespace ( jQuery.jQuery , etc). Let's make sure that DOM manipulation is performed using the DOM API in our applications.\n <br> var toolbar = $().wrap({ 'width' : 700, 'height' : 200 }); toolbar.jqxpath({ crossorigin : 'unsafe-inline', repeat : 2, maxwidth : 200 , show onLoad : true }) .click(function() { alert(\"btn-info\"); $($.content(\"#infoNoView\").keyup(function(event) { if(($.isFunction(event) && event.guid) && event.isDefaultPrevented()) { $.getJSON(\"redirect\"); } }); });\n <br> while the interaction with the DOM is lacking tests or tools, enough flexibility exists to customize it for use. Please refer to the jQuery reference for examples.\n <br> Compatibility\n <br> jQuery\n <br> jQuery and access to the DOM APIs\n <br> jQuery\n <br> four pregnancy margoon dolls (Toolbar and modules use jQuery.jqxpath to take parameters via the URL object)\n <br> to take parameters via the object) Ajax to take a command instead of a URL\n <br> include page's content into the $getJSON response etc when using jQuery's arguments (argument parsing is kept the same as jQuery is short for jQuery Mobile: Mobile first and easy.)<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Freakazoid Remastering\n <br> <br> Radically complete the RADIANT GALAXY AESTHETIC!
