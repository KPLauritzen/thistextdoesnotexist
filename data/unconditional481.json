{"output": "Want to know what barriers await the U.S. picketers at the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 picket lines in New York and Rhode Island today? No wonder the Union is celebrating its 150th anniversary today.\n <br> Tasked with drawing attention to employers who fire union members and protest low wages and bad working conditions, USW Local 226 members have done both -- often in large crowds. New York labor law requires that picketers be allowed to demonstrate \"reasonably and freely.\" This can encompass a wide range of attitudes about working conditions, wages and many other social issues that are relevant to open shop. Not surprisingly, many union members understand not giving in when challenged is the price of retaining a job.\n <br> <br> We try to stay abreast of the picketer hysteria, as illustrated by former New York City Mayor Ed Koch, who last week called out the NYC demo of Microsoft protesters going to New York where the Union is organizing a $15 minimum wage: \"They're going to be union labor and talk when needed and sustain the pressure when the union will give it to them. Now they're takeaways dinner, scribbling notes, leaving anything unique for post and say the heck with us. You know what they'll say to that? They'll say, 'Thank you for supporting the strike. We'll be back. At a ride for tips.'\"\n <br> <br> While the picketers get their messages out ahead of many union pickets, understanding nonviolent direct action and tactics can be crucial in averting such incidents. So get on the frontlines of picketing to avoid the potentially traumatic outburst. Take notes for at-home protests and compensation for police incidents, and hopefully these will get you on with a comfortable workday.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Copy and paste this link into an e-mail or instant message: http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/The-Legend-of-Zelda-The-Windwaker/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584109fe?cid=SLink Click to create and send a link using your email application\n <br> Play with your favorite Zelda characters, including Link, Zelda, Impa, Agitha and more.
