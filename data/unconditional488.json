Indeed, we show that speciation can proceed within a species within 400 generations within an avian species, despite a background of gene flow. The value of this result depends on whether we compensate for a lack of gene flow by placing a strong limit on the number of sexual reproduction as with smaller speciated species. We find that selecting for a peaceful community imposes a far larger cost on species speciation than genetic diversity tradeoffs and inherent sexual incompatibilities, a behavior which contradicts the well-established presumption that gene flow can generate even smaller cost.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Cine those dreaded Death Star, here's the killer art from the upcoming movie, 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens.' (Photo: Lucasfilm)\n <br> For those of us who have not been paying attention, today was 2 years ago today we were flooded with the news that J.J. Abrams had been hired as the director of Star Wars follow-up, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Since then, we've watched the movie on Star Wars Day, watched every teaser trailer and the rest of the trailers to bring us up to speed.\n <br> And today Canadian stand-up comics Andy Kindler and Mike Chapman released the Q&A segment of their new podcast, #Beany & Andy Kindler Live, for the latest fans to catch up with the show.\n <br> Kent has been keeping everyone updated with clips from Los Frisos that Lucasfilm has made public over the past few days, but hopefully they will have a full CGI reveal in the coming weeks.\n <br> For now, however, Kindler got fans hyped again over the news that came out this morning; Lucas requested that a new Green Lantern game be made for the Xbox One and PS4 in 2015.\n <br> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, director J.J. Abrams said that the game would feature a new Lantern and his origin story.\n <br> \"He's not The Necro Primo,\" Abrams said. \"He's not scarred and hardened in some sort of way. He's got time on this world. So this is this strange corner of the universe about to show people what they might get into if they learn the truth about these key rings.\"\n <br> Wow! That sounds like a very different feel than Green Lantern when a man with the ability to wield the powers of the living dimension fights crime. And if that not enough, you might just hear something the cast and crew of LFR have been begging for: Deadman.\n <br> \"Lucas asked me, you know, what would be the new kind of nemesis for Hal Jordan? What's his private darkest secret?\" Blake says. \"It's really sweet. When we finally found something that he was really, really open about \u2014 because apparently he'd been hiding this story from everyone forever \u2014 then we kind of had to keep it locked down. We had to attack work on the next job very, very, very carefully.\"\n <br> We have to admit, the thought of Mr. Miracle or Green Lantern leaving the force feels a lot tease and graphic to roll with. We envision it pretty violent, but...\n <br> With that said, a new Green Lantern game is sound!\n <br> Emily Asher-Perrin is a Los Angeles-based freelance writer and the editor of The Mary Sue on Rookie too.
