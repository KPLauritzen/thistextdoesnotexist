He had arrived partway through his morning business meeting on the third floor, a gem of a 19th-century masterpiece he had built on a narrow suspension bridge spanning the nearby Suez Canal. The view east across the canal lanes to the houses of Cairo and Alexandria and the small island of Suez was stunning.\n <br> Beckey might have had the perfect place for his sales conference at lodge number 7091217, but services had to put up with protestors when the hotel opened that morning, and they forced Beckey to drive around with demonstrators outside his hotel. He told MSNBC this afternoon that he drove as if he was a cop trying to protect the hotel.\n <br> Beckey had prior reasons for believing the hotel would be denied the usual police escort.\n <br> The whole thing was immensely complicated, Beckey said. Despite the segregation\u2014white and black bedrooms, separate dining room, etc.\u2014he found it easy to find unity and even relaxation. They fed the demonstrators to great success. (Traffic cones!!) And, according to another hotel guest who obstructed Beckey on purpose.\n <br> White nationalists, who used the hotel to convene racist gatherings, proudly declared it \"our little fortress\" through the day and down at 6 p.m., there was a flag-waving cadre from Joseph Goebbels' and Hitler's HQs from \"Birkenau\" holding the German Black Cross with swastika on it around, and chanting \"reunite the German people!\" They then escorted these folks home.\n <br> Here's the full extended interview with Beckey edited for length and clarity:<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>She's a complete bitch.\n <br> <br> Too bad she lost her slot in all those great music festivals... No, I don't hate her. If she held lefties responsible in these \"strong female voices\" videos, that would be so AMAZING. The arrogance and entitlement this woman shows in her attitude is painful. Onion has had his shit laid out for him. He/she was overall disgusting, and I just missed out on all that manic pixie dream girl goodness.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>AFuT:Ch2 P: the AFTQ in Ch 2 will be available from Preload Prebooster Arcade Therein is no legal restriction to distributing any copyrighted\n <br>"}
