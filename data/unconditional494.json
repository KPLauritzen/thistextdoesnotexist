In an online interview at Sony's booth during this week's E3, Mangou clarified, \"There isn't a stand-alone demon, there are several kinds of demons.\"\n <br> He also stated that there are five demon types in the game. \"Demon of Lord\" is the first demon encountered, it happens to be the one that steals the Devil's Red Chain. And so, that leads us to the cliffhanger where the demon succeeds in using it to create a new demon. And then we get out to find out what this new demon's goal is. If you have watched the trailer, you'll note that for some reason the demon looks very familiar.\"\n <br> Exit Theatre Mode\n <br> Other details about the game include, \"God of War\" looks amazing and offers a chance to explore locations that appear in the previous games. Prior to this E3, Sony Computer Entertainment executive SIE Worldwide Studios boss Shuhei Yoshida told IGN, \"a lot of it comes back to your actions and weapons. Our in-engine footage so far shows that it really puts people at the heart of the battles.\"\n <br> God of War is set for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Windows PC this October in North America and October in Europe. The game will be sold as a disc-based digital download.

Chris Smith of New Jersey, which would require congressional approval for the eventual inclusion of the TPP in any final trade deal as part of the process of modernizing trade agreements.\n <br> \"I'm for the president,\" Clinton said. \"I voted for him and will remain after I'm in the White House.\"\n <br> \"But Indonesia, our culture is different than theirs,\" CBS correspondent Scott Pelley replied. \"And the way you're negotiating Asia is that the TPP is everything to us. And it is making us less competitive?\"\n <br> Answering that, Clinton argued that U.S. culture and pre-modern trading priorities were so different \"us\" that they shouldn't be compartmentalized.\n <br> \"I want to move forward thinking we can get much more integrated into the rest of the world and less dependent on having to pursue those alliances when it's convenient to us,\" she added.\n <br> But as Politico has previously noted, support for the Smith bill is not necessarily unanimous. Many Democratic Party bosses, including some of its most prominent Democrats, are against it, including considerable pockets of the grassroots, including the 2012 vice presidential nominee Joe Biden, who voted in favor of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Representative Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, a former member of the Congressional Black Caucus, also opposes the President's trade proposals, but is not against the Smith bill.\n <br> The Smith bill before Congress would declare the U.S. to be a party to the deal, saving it from the process that would require 60 votes of the relevant U.S. Senate, but would have other potential pitfalls, including the possibility of influencing the outcome of late D.C. negotiations between the United States and Japan. As the New York Times notes:\n <br> Should those happen, efforts to block the trade deal could bolster opponents, since opposition launched one week after President Obama pledged to make changes about U.S. trade policy, such as a stronger commitment to workers' rights and the rights of women and minorities.\n <br> On the other side, a core Clinton constituency in both New York state and Washington will advocate strongly for passage. Credentials show that a coalition of 12 Democratic State Assembly members in upstate New York and D.C. has put together an 11-member Working Families Party, but if the bill passes in its current form, Clinton and the D.C. clique will presumably stand to gain the most from the increasing agitation that would result if they continued opposing the deal until it was defeated in Congress.\n <br> \"Though the TPP is finalized, take action to stop it,\" wrote the D.C. and New York Working Families party in an email to members urging them to call their congressional representatives. \"We can and we will fix this broken\n <br>"}
