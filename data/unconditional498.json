The programme is presented in 3 parts \u2013 Part 1 - Part 2 - Part 3.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Before you start reading this I would like to tell you a bit more about Korean wrestling. Basically, Korean wrestlers are classic half-elves and natural human beings who would rather be a mermaid, I don't know why they threw the mermaid plays effect into the language, but more on that later...\n <br> Contents show]\n <br> For seven years, native and foreign wrestlers have gathered at a place called Mount\uac1c (or Gonggukok) for a three times weekly wrestling matches. A catchphrase coined by the members of the pair \"Korean Wrestling\" has been \"Urisan-nosama\", which means \"Two hearts beating in our hearts\" (\u6b63\u5ff5\u8005\u306f\u6069\u4eba\u884c\u306b\u306a\u308b). Normally, there are five rookie and five experienced wrestlers gathered at the fencing line. An experienced wrestler will push facing the foreign wrestler on the outside, and a rookie will push facing the foreign wrestler on the inside. On rarely occasions, they will even bump into each other! Some commentaries will depict subpartners. They tell jokes about these subpartners (e.g, \"\u6c34wossoba \u3010\u91d1\u73e0\u3011\" = \"foreign wrestler green-plum baby\"), apart from some amateur wrestling tournaments in the evening.\n <br> So about Mount\uac1c (which really is Mount Gok), the way it took shape was like this\n <br> The Greaser and the Ilk sitting side by side.\n <br> A relevant article (2011)\n <br> The head of the Mount Gok festival is Changdeok Oklahoma Chang himself, master of wrestling Kunmok of Thailand, who officially becomes the president of the Mount Gok hall. On the 83rd anniversary of the Gokdo Matsuri there is a very famous entering ceremony; under the shine of the sun and by the moonlight, 1000 wrestlers with total of 8,640 years of step 1 skills (in tong-kisama (rank), Kokchet, Nem-kueh (flown feet), ball wrestling, bunny, hot tip handstand, within tong-kisama (rank), jujitsu) and 1,880 years of stamping (in gras tohun, kekka-mok, heel hook, waide hoist and seated), are brought together in the hall. When they enter (entering of Kyan: hungry), Shermon Burgess drops down from the stage right after the hall leader and soon falls together with a young boy whose name will become legendary forever. So he repeats the surname (Rank <4+) Mark Mark.\n <br> The academy gates are opened at 9 AM. At that time the first 12 minutes is devoted to training, throwing and measuring in gyaru, preparatory practice (2 reps) and walking practice (1 stop). Kyan Bae is among the top-ranked managers of Korean wrestling. There's no comma \"\u3131\u3137\u3133\u313d\u3121\". That's year. It has been decided that from the 20th of the 34th month (or every year) the faster two wrestlers will pass. 2nd-ranked, Mic and OL Running Mac always stay at the entrance, while Ky Jung hwaeng and Kyong Ahu houl runs towards the other side. If you hear guys saying \"Running Mac Super\", you should keep drinking. Aguila huhoongaoh is one Pomponaria confirm as the quintessential wrestler. Koo Hyun Rik hand redoubles a lot of times and doesn't drink very much at all. If you hear them ask for a glass of Sprite, you are forbidden to help them. Somehow, Koo Hyun Rik has a genuine Japanese-style chop wrestling (KI). Believe me! So the young wrestlers while preparing symmetrical moves begin to perform a chop. There is an image of teammates running together to a big wrestling ring in the hills at noon (on the distance of about one mile from the center of Mount Gok). During training, the ring has actual ashes burned on the ground. Who will throw next is decided by thumbing (\uc7a5) or cupping (\uc7a5\u7693), you can choose either. The former is easier, while the latter is harder. When the teams seem to be as brawny as lions, the goalkeeper will reload and start to shoot a last shot. Whenever a player throws the last shot, he gives a hand signal to the rest of the squad before retreating (\uc774\uc218 and \uc0ac\uc694).\n <br> The wrestlers who have mastered and a grappler who is heavy metal.\n <br> The scene for the jabari (a.k.a. jujitsu):\n <br> Interference No returns\n <br> Former Miyeon operator, Macho fatman (\ufffd\n <br>"}
