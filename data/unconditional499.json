{"output": "Microsoft introduced the Hello Cortana/Force Touch feature inside of Cortana on the same day it was announced at IFA 2017.\n <br> If you, like us, have been coveting this feature for ages, it seems that Microsoft enabled it for you too.\n <br> According to a tip sent to us by Ronny Schroeiber, Microsoft has quietly enabled expanded wear and gesture options inside of Cortana on the phone, enabling you to control the display with your fingerprints, pinch to zoom and press the trackpad with your fingertips.\n <br> However, it begs the question \"if someone is watching this, can they actually interact with Cortana's features?\n <br> We've always known that Microsoft technology can detect and take action on biometrics and gesture control. The ability to do this in a specific type of software has always been a huge deal and such measures usually have personal organisers working behind the scenes. The theory is that because Cortana is optional inside of Cortana on the phone, it therefore needs this extra human intervention as part of its beta testing process.\n <br> What do you think of Microsoft enabling the possibilities of situational awareness via Cortana's new section?<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>NORFOLK \u2014 The Moody's legal team quietly released a written statement to the City Clerk last week from the financial damageonies company.\n <br> They also released a video, showcasing Moody's claim of \"serious fraud,\" focusing on the city's foreclosure program, due to its failed oversight. The video coincides with Public Times coverage of the Moody's audit that notes there is no evidence of any financial improprieties in any CPD proceedings, on City programs or in government expenditure accounts.\n <br> In the video, Mark Moody of Moody's begins by noting there is an accepted version of events that blame Chekwonaung for the housing bubble, housing foreclosures and other actions. He says the report highlights the City of Norfolk's \"shocking financial mismanagement and ethics problem\".\n <br> He says that there are many more accounts to be looked at to see what types of fraud are committed and identify inefficiencies in both the City of Norfolk's foreclosure enforcement and its finance and governance arrangements.\n <br> He says that without new imaginative policies for cities, many other municipal whistleblowers, residents and citizens may fall victim to suspects hiding behind screen names and complete disregard for their whistle blowing.\n <br> Then he says, \"This renewed focus on financial mismanagement; rule of law, accountability, responsibility, keeping track of budgets, and other policies by public servants, has been grossly understated and marketed as the main reason as to why governance will improve; all of which are false.\"\n <br> <br> Moody's Legal Statement\n <br> Originally, the office of Mayor Tim Curran announced the unanimous release of the decision with the statement, \"The auditors noted only minor discrepancies\" regarding the actions of the former City Manager Kenneth Oliver.\n <br> The written statement from Alex Schnetbein, general counsel and executive officer for Moody's Corporate Office, says that despite the report's findings that there is no evidence of non-compliance, \"the auditor did not interview any third party witnesses. The report concluded there was no fault with the overall maintenance process for foreclosures.\"\n <br> Moody's did interview former City Manager Kenneth Oliver, he says, about what was done and how deceased foreclosures were reviewed and whether there were claims of problems.\n <br> The statement, whodnosecretoplay.com, is available in its entirety on the City website.\n <br> Here is the snippet:\n <br> \"The full extent of the City's foreclosures is, of course, unknown. However, I want to make it perfectly clear that it was not 'small deployments' that affected the City's code compliance scores \u2014 it was the kind of repetitive, recurrent, and wide spread red flag issues that can jeopardize an individual city's code compliance score (or worse). What happens when thousands of loans, in the form of improper foreclosures or otherwise defective proceedings have been ever referred to the Court Collects, regardless of the involvement of families who lost their homes? If a local court is sitting empty, then how will that impact the many thousands of companies that routinely represent homeowners who are here for the wrong reasons (an accuracy bias, a breakdown in the document review process, or the misrepresentation by several parties in the transaction)? To what degree does \"issue reporting\" jeopardize issues of housing preparation and payments of debts among the Municipalities that debt collectors may log onto? These are just a few detailed averages presented by the Moody's audit where instructio n was outstanding. The auditors ... found no abuses of procedures or practices such as the vast combinations breach of departmental protocols, mismanagement, or for which those acts were attributable to a specific person or attempts to hide them. Finally, consequential misguided implementing of rents capitalization procedures were placed on the back burner as a result of a lack of government officials who had to justify them in detail. This is clearly an area that needs to be re-examined\n <br>"}
