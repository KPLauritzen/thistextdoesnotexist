{"output": "Stephen Colbert started off CBS' \"Late Show\" Wednesday night by thanking Gary Sinise, who was doing stand-up comedy with collaborator Will Martin at the Juilliard School in New York City shortly before Fallon took over.\n <br> \"One of our truest stories right here is this guy Sinise and this guy Martin, who was on the New York City improv scene with him,\" Colbert explained. \"They're from a very similar background. These guys were our boys. So this episode I'm doing a bit about Gary, and about something he said to me, possibly in the heat of the moment. This was in L.A. They were on the floor, and Gary got back on stage and pulled out this plastic bag where he was sleeping. And he said: 'Look at the nose of this sack of shit! God, what a nose!'\"\n <br> \"That's what I still have on my bucket list\" \u2013 and what isn't, appears to be a series of wide-ranging philosophical ruminations - \"I'm going to do an audience response,\" Colbert then concluded, \"to Gary Sinise's joke. He's going to tell me whether people are just going to love it or have that old-fashioned sense of discomfort.\"\n <br> Fetty Wap kicked things off, but it wasn't long before President Donald Trump showed up on the show. \"We've never had the president of the United States on Late Night but we had this one crazed nightmare. He was under a giant commandeered helicopter, flying the coop,\" Colbert said, leading up to what could have been a frightening parody of Sinise's bad face joke.\n <br> But when he turned up the volume, Colbert realized what he was referring to. \"We did hear him running around the room,\" a worried Colbert admitted.\n <br> Fallon emerged to go sit in on the impersonation of a Hollywood star parodying Trump before doing some splashy lunacy as the president. But once again, Sinise turned out to be the one (or two) laughing behind Trump. \"When we heard him out, we heard his voice a little bit muffled,\" Colbert relayed. \"But it was enough. That's when we all started freaking out.\" Howard Stern's caller, who came in for an interview about the clown lawsuit, presumably from the sight of Vanilla Ice's head popping overnight on the ceiling, told Fallon to \"give him a Christmas discount!\" Fallon did so, but Sinise wasted no time the moment the door slammed.\n <br> \"He grabbed that night stick and ran out!\" Colbert said \"He ran out, and we can't hear anything that is being said at all, so we're all just sort of\u2026 Sol\n <br> Sinosi?\" Colbert finally recovered, realizing what has happened. Kellyanne Conway stepped in. \"That's just very, very scary!\" she exclaimed.\n <br> \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/U0v5iH8sZq \u2014 WTO Crossfire (@WTOpush) October 28, 2017\n <br> <br> James Corden quickly joined the segment. \"I think the President is shocked,\" Bono lamented. \"My first thought was: 'I hate comedy.' I know the whole country hates comedy. I don't usually fight but this was insane.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>680 votes\n <br> \"The Past and the Future at the Same Time\"\n <br> Kazuma enters the school's science club in order to successfully enter kindergarten.

Largely composed of high school students in tight-fitting vacant uniforms, they walked away believing that Gagarin was the next North America's greatest athlete. However, the article has stated that this was just after Gagarin's spectacular on-field win, in which he also won 3 gold, 2 silver and 1 bronze.\n <br> The five soldiers seated beside Gagarin were Red Army soldiers. Growth and later pinpointing the exact moment that Gagarin made it official with the Soviet flag is where interpretation has varied. There's scant footage of the game itself, and poor quality Soviet footage is likely the best we have available of Gagarin's win, which involves pushing a quadraplane, shooting off his rocket and gliding it into the net from an elevated base.\n <br> Gagarin's first two major international games were against England in Vraska and in Spain. He made his international debut at 14 in Goulburn, and competed in 100m, 200m and 400m at Runden Stadium in the same year. His greatest tournament came in the five-race 1969 World Long\u2011Distance Air Race. In a completely unexpected feat, he won combined freestyle and butterfly at Sabre Park in Goulburn.
