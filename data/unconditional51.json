Averaging about $320,000 a car, that's $610 million worth of racing machines bought with disposable funds by the sport. Coupled with the 250,000-plus fans ticket-holders themselves, the total cost of organizing and promoting the sport is not insignificant.\n <br> Here's a brief snapshot of what teams pay (per season): There is the obvious base cost of technology. There is the high technology cost which includes fuel, engine oil and brake pads. Turbo complex and drivelines, as well as tire sizes and different car designs cost more.\n <br> Then there is the cost of constructing a proper field and fixing damage incurred over a race and if cars crash, the Haswell CPUs are in use afterward. All additional horsepower comes at additional expense, but these are convenience foils to the costs of the other components found in many high-end trackday cars.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> If the costs of building and maintaining a car are ambiguous, fielding it is even riskier. Teams are now and will always have a large lead on funding such programs and deals that involve the need to buy rest of the season is a major enterprise. Meanwhile there's even the chance someone might unwittingly start building a race car for a team that accidentally \"inadvertently\" supplies race homologation plates whose program could be invalid and considered a competitor's.\n <br> So the costs are practically staggering, the risk makes racing among young talent undesirable, and the goal of exponentially reducing the cost of building and racing cars seems still to be just out of reach.\n <br> Overall, $700 million raised in the last 10 years is nothing to sniff at, it is merely a small fraction of what one project budgeted (Lester's Spyker team was about $350 million when he died), but it's nevertheless an absurdity.\n <br> 2012 was the first year (or short of the first) to get an officially approved chassis cost guide, but before that a period in which the teams of DCU's Jay Penske and the Williams F1 team were given cryptic budgets by Colin Kolles (the calendar execmen at Monaco) to make vague recommendations to their teams. With no detailed chassis cost guide, some teams, like Williams, accepted a bulk of the ancien r\u00e9gime for comfort.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> But a few things happened in 2011, because of the Formula One Sporting Regulations reform and performance-fueled revenue changes (kind-by-kind and quarter-by-quarter fees, in effect turning the sport into a cast-off AutoZone), it ballooned to be over $3.5 billion. In December 2011, Daimler and ACO president Max Mosley announced that they would combine efforts to tune the carbonfibre everyone had agreed to build for the field into a more aggressive, road-legal set.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> Given the disinterest in granular production and table-clogging costs over marginal gains like points, it's indicative of what the sport is about: Old-timer Formula 1 must appeal to the wealthiest (thus those who sometimes circumvent anti-bribery laws like the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), a few mad scientist types with Ricciardo money, and those who would probably pay more if they could (think church through church money, business through business funding). These few groups alone could make Formula One a three-car race. This year will see some big money teams\u2014Ferrari, McLaren, Mercedes, and Red Bulls\u2014is move up to the top 10 with Williams increasing from 6th to 5th, with Lotus being the next biggest upstart after having been a shoo-in for alarmingly small Saudi money.\n <br> The most important thing concerns the question of what to do about engine development costs. Plans for 2013 are still shaky. Ievgeny Koch went to an overpriced powertrain-maker after his strife with Mercedes explained that engine rules against championships were in favor of his specialized technologies, but the Williams test team had even the smallest and cheapest competitors at bay (a cobbled engine under challenges when a budget objections bought official backing, near to a joint venture with the computer-generation tech cast off in truth). For that, Josh Rice that became close friends with Koch ended with failure.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> What we learnt is that the technology still working well for winners\n <br>"}
