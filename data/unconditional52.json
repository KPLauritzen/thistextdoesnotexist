Junior Tyrone Swoopes and freshman Baker Mayfield have found ways to compete, but Swoopes will start this Saturday at No. 3 Louisiana Tech (8 p.m., ESPN). Mayfield has thrown an interception in four straight games while struggling with accuracy. He did throw a touchdown Sunday night, but even that was a bit of goose egg.\n <br> \u2022 Kamryn Pettway was tagged with a 213-yard receiving performance against Texas: He has out-touched the six receivers who have appeared on the OU rushing roster combined.
