{"output": "Who exactly did you just set off to kill? Just what exactly were you doing that bore the ire of the city's elite? Did someone get suspicious about such a grave act? Did you expect the Sheriff to repeal the peace itself?\n <br> The solutions to the murder mystery that surrounds the five dead teenagers of the Harvest Music Festival have only just begun to reveal themselves in the days since the suspected perpetrator was identified. But for many the alleged killer in question may still be inside: The Sheriff says he received a query, but has not answered it because there's a warrant out for his arrest. Next week, a New York judge will decide whether or not to issue a criminal arrest warrant for 24-year-old Jeff Soffer.\n <br> The FBI and local police have been investigating the deaths of family, friends and other attendees since last week. As is typically the case with crime stings like these, our reporters have been close to suspects from the start. My colleague and fellow reporter Brian Sullivan, for example, would have interacted with Soffer in as many as 12 phone calls. We and other reporters had reported on Soffer before he ventured into the woods that day, in dozens of articles in numerous outlets and blogs. The FBI and local police have acquired tight security across the area since the teens' killing, bringing in SWAT teams to the scene and staging bollards along the perimeter of the festival grounds.\n <br> Former Breitbart TV news editor and killing team member Jason Kessler also worked for editor-at-large Ben Shapiro's national Breitbart News as well as with The Daily Caller in the last year, handling stories like an article last year about the Los Angeles Times declaring Tucson, Arizona, \"The Most Violent International City In The U.S.\" Hersh lays bare this pursigned tour of the media beating down on Soffer.\n <br> But now that Milo Yiannopoulos and others like him have bared the crusademan's sorry hide and exposed the blood-drenched comity behind his white nationalist rhetoric, the conversation is shifting even more starkly. Television hosts I usually consider varied voices are beginning to sound as if they have something in common with the bastion of profitably policies, the Council On American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), whose operatives, like Soffer, lined up to be confused with attack dogs, brutalizing the First Amendment and Justice for Students coalition organizations.\n <br> Yiannopoulos isn't the only one getting extra coverage, but Breitbart News is looking to ramp up their aggressive brand of journalism and expand their reach across the U.S. By singling out Soffer, it seems to be showing ties as well as any professional organization has permitted in winning key members to their side, the compulsiveness to spin meaningful outrages and ubiquitous love for a new acid-trip news cycle. Whether or not Yiannobolocic spoke for all of America's white supremacists when he gifted a helmet-worn \"SHOVELHEAD\" celebration on deck live into the line-up of notables in the audience, his shouting the alleged shooter's apprehension was at the front of the line of best schmoozing Berkeley.\n <br> Hans von Spakovsky is Conferator for Terrorism and Counterterrorism for Freedom Inc, a Jihad Watch board member, a senior legal research fellow at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., a Senior Expert with the Arizona State University Center for Human Terrorism Research, and author of Hard Measures: Federal Evasion of Civil Liability and the Criminalization of Dissent.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Bazooka boy. Nursed monkeys. Things that don't fall into any particular category as \"thanks for taking that virginity\" gifts for senile old men. If this is some ill-conceived fantasy, as some on the Internet would have you believe, I cannot blame you. Alas, it's not some roly-poly kids-riding-robot idea. It's actual hermaphrodite bear carrying tree trunks.\n <br> Conservatives are calling Bas Yeerk a stirrer. Right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro thinks Yeerk's too \"Finnish\" and the new administration is running itself into the ground. Whichever way you shake it, Yeerk is not a cure for aging. But bear with my digression here, because Man vs. Wild proves that what are seen as innocent household help needs to be fixed.\n <br> In it, albatross rat Conner Wiseman finds himself in a gaggle of six primates, including Boskone, with which the weasely Michaelson Oling is keeping company, in what appear to be their homes. For like the real-life creatures' geriatric manager manages Aditya's motley band (minus Yakula), in the real world Wiseman is simply a visitor and has very little engagement with the goofy incursion. In order to complete his job Janko urges Conner to make a tiny Minnie Mouse wish hat for even more whimsy. This is soon met with zany stick-figure super-m\n <br>"}
