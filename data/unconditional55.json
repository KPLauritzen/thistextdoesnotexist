{"output": "iStockphoto\n <br> A former St. Louis and Boerne police sergeant says he was fired from his job after telling his manager that he had seen young black men burglarize a fast-food restaurant twice in the past two years.\n <br> Shreveport officer Ramiro Gonzalez testified Wednesday in Texas Superior Court that an African-American co-worker was concerned about his conduct, and projected to bystanders an image of Gonzalez in an anti-police hat 17 feet away from the St. Louis County Police investigation.\n <br> On the witness stand, Gonzalez said the incident unintentionally became a race-related case when a white pressure-cooker vendor in the bakery where he worked, felt threatened by the stilletto Herrera.\n <br> The bakery owner. Brian Holzman, said it was assumed his employee saw scissors in the officer's pocket and walked out. right to the police station. Later, the St. Louis County Police may have been called for questions.\n <br> <br> \"The whole incident was designed to showcase how I fancied Huey (Palmer),\" Joseph Servilla testified.\n <br> <br> Gonzalez worked for the St. Louis County Police Department for four years until his termination in March 2014, after an investigation was launched following a complaint from a colleague. After being granted a temporary stay of all charges in a felony racketeering case, Gonzalez sued St. Louis County Police, the city and its chief, Daniel Davis, a week later.\n <br> <br> Servilla listened to the testimony as Gonzalez's lawyer, Aaron Nosse, questioned whether police needed a business with a concealed pressure-cooker, deli, coffee shop and a motel to have security. Servilla testified that Ramiro Gonzalez carried a loaded shotgun on duty as a rifle. He encountered a 48 year old white male who spent time on the bayside and burglarized a store twice beginning on August 4, 2012.\n <br> <br> \"When you find another and replicate it,\" he said \"I'm out of a job.\"\n <br> <br> Servilla also claims Gonzalez brought to work what was then-classified as a restricted weapon. Nonetheless, in occurring with Gonzalez's sole intent to make his customers uncomfortable, the Bakery's Manager Jim Guthrie didn't deport him.\n <br> <br> Hierading such a report on his bosses creates negative accolades and denigrates the police, Nosse testified. He told the jury that he is dismayed at what he interpreted to be lingering racism and said that he hasn't taken the police to court.\n <br> However, the NAACP president shot back that their suit would be racism proof. Ken Oberholtzer began his day in a St. Louis County courtroom where the attorneys defending Davis, outside the officer's office, reportedly called him a traitor and a gun-wielding rabble-rouser. Overturned by a large majority of the county, the judge declared the board unanimously cleared its officers.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>India today sentenced Pakistan's 277 prisoners to hang for killing 58 people by stampede after onset of monsoon in Agra.\n <br> Law-enforcement personnel have been with Agra in Agra\n <br> <br> Russia 'decide to delay' China-Pakistan economic corridor\n <br> India today sentenced Pakistan's 277 prisoners to hang for killing 58 people by stampede after onset of monsoon in Agra.\n <br> \"The event this March helped to make agra city a witness that what happens in Pakistan cannot happen in India,\" convicted Congressman Prajapati Rajaramaidh told a special court here.\n <br> Those convicted in the 2013 incident at Agra's famous Taj Mahal were accused of causing deaths through negligence, rioting, cheating and mischief.\n <br> Praise be to god for the spiritual strength and courage of humanity http://t.co/dWzdZX5C7L \u2014 Shiv Sena (@senaicsena) January 17, 2015\n <br> \"This incident clearly proved that terror-related incidents in India are a result of law and order breakdown, leading to anarchy and lawlessness,\" Rajaramaidh wrote in his judgment.\n <br> \"Every nation including Bhopal is heading in the same direction.
