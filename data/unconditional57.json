{"output": "Add it to the forecast for next year \u2014 the fires of global warming will push the seas up, bringing waves to many parts of the Pacific Northwest, the NOAA said today.\n <br> Much of the Columbia River Basin from western Oregon and northern California to southern California will see storm surges rising, according to the agency's National Weather Service.\n <br> Today saw the agency update their outlook for next year, forecasting an increase in fires of 15 percent or more, with 22 percent of that seen in that area of the Northwest.\n <br> With a 5 percent storm surge in the area, the forecast system calls for greater concern.\n <br> \"Nine of the mountains along the Columbia will see strong storms between early October and mid-December, and the normal winter storm surge would exceed 10 feet by Thanksgiving,\" said a forecast from the agency.\n <br> Stories at the Daily News of Rocky Mountain Northwest commented on the news with concern about rivers and beaches, as high tides build in persistent clouds.\n <br> [How local wetness or flooding could diminish the potential of WW 3]\n <br> Some researchers expressed concern about the news today, referring to the catastrophic and horrific consequences of the 2014 wildfires in the Pacific Northwest.\n <br> \"I worry the reason we don't take stronger action on climate change is that we are due for a major event,\" John Coequyt, professor emeritus at Oregon State University, told the Daily News.\n <br> \"The Hyper-Cap66 project predicted that this year's wildfire season on land was equivalent to 15 years of wildfires elsewhere in Oregon,\" he said. \"We have seen a 50 percent increase in forest fires since spring. If you add a 20 percent increase in sub-surface heat from drought, you can expect this year even more fire season.\"\n <br> There was a recent increase in wildfire prospects, north of Phoenix, Ariz., spurred by a warm front bearing down on the region next week, the National Weather Service reported. That contrast may lead some grumpy environmentalists to be contemplating how they can flip the scenario to avoid a bigger battle.\n <br> \"I wonder how many of the fires these environmentalists are currently blaming on our burning of fossil fuels were (or wont to be) global warming, seedier dinosaur bugs, blah blah,\" Coequyt said. \"I'm hopeful we will rule out our children's survival, but life is precious.\"\n <br> [There's another monster weather event that could knock out power for a quarter million U.S. homes by 2020]\n <br> <br> Heavy smoke from fires lit by the deadliest wildfires in state history looms over Oroville, Calif., on Sunday.

Finally, the weather service announced its final count for wildfires, observing that last year's devastating fires, fueled by warmer temperatures, killed at least 167 people.\n <br> Washington froze less than half of its land areas covered by ice, and the biggest area of direct exposure was in the Cascades, the weather service said in its outlook.\n <br> James Chesser, snow specialist at the National Weather Service in Spokane, said he was shocked to see Cascades and Cascade Mountains in the brunt of winter storms today.\n <br> \"Wow,\" he said. \"Today's storms were the very worst since 2015. They made a darn strong sight difficult to miss \u2014 these huge updrafts blowing snow into our backcountry out past Oroville and even farther inland.\"\n <br> Yes, we have four big news cycles coming our way (even before Thanksgiving.)
