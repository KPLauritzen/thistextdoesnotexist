{"output": "This is actually easier to do than you think! Go out and get the leftovers of a roast or something of that nature. Parboil them for a little while. (That's what I did, if you were curious) Heat up your wok in the $medium hotish flame, drizzle in some oil, then toss the contents of the too-long messy roast for about 10 seconds or so. The wok will release steam and some surface starch which will help the stir fry singe. Spread the rice in your wok, the aromatics and proteins will absorb the undigested starch, so it will help the starch brown nicely. When all the rice-starch is brown and the rice is smooth and tender, fold in the dried white beans. It's that easy! You can even add in some fresh broccoli or other dark green veggies if you want a rich yet quick wrap soup. If you put a little more, like I did, the brown stuff willy-nilly over everything , which will color the right rainbow. Besides, it's are nicely flavored with the rice and dried lentils, not with expensive, too-frequent imported beans. I like to bring it all to a boil and let it sit more than an hour or so. So delicious!
