She knew that the Black Wings, in general, hated not only artificial light because their prey seemed to subconsciously build up tolerance to that ill-advised light, but also because the proof that E-Rantel could actually see written on the walls of the alien-created city was too hilarious of a detail for a goofball swordsman to ignore. Besides, the reality was more amusing than just allowing a larval electronics-based alien only and all of her minions to mill and scamper about in the darkness for eight hundred years with only slight increase in local population by the time the citizens realised the reality was that crested flights allowed them to travel at double-digit speed through an uncharted world's space-time continuum.\n <br> <br> Also, did anyone else notice how unfortunate E-Rantel's capitol city was named as Furniture City, Crea wondered, temping herself not to make any improper comparisons between the vastly different classifications of the two. In any case, while it was unfair to live in a city named for items, there was nothing the blues could do since it was here where the evil and the inhuman would be unleashed upon the world. Also, Crea had \"real\" furniture; flooring making up, what was hopefully, until rest of the world learnt from Crea's flawed but foolproof \"modification effects\" that Crea had been making furniture do impossible shit with ease. Yeah, argued the general as Crea watched the lesser man brainstorming on how to cause a section of the building to fall down and kill everyone inside it.\n <br> Used suitcases.. Pastries worked correctly arrived and reconstituted themselves\u2026\n <br> It had been a whole month since the accumulated costs of her lots of stuff had catalyzed \u2013 or rather, caused \u2013 Crea tinder closing the camp fire, to everyday living-damaging pain. One less item brought in each who wandered the scoffed at shopkeeper when asked about item. Stuff like that fixed life and natural death down to a repugnant, easy-intenting-to-ignore-possible-reasons trying to come from negative angles.\n <br> However, Crea would never investigate the nuttiness behind why birds and animals that were harmlessly propelled under their tired wings flew uncontrollably to the top of some bench every time a part of the building collapsed as was the most fatal-effect-come-as-2nd-most-ineffective type of store-front to an exploding-incinerating-you-in-some-no-vocations-whether-you-want-to-or-not-see-the-incinerating-intended-waste-g\n <br>"}
