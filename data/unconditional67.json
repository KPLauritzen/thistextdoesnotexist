{"output": "Think U.S. institutions require too much security? Well, if you have access to Tor, you don't. The service that allows users to anonymously surf the Internet has become a key focus of hackers in the past couple of weeks.\n <br> The revelation came earlier this week following Reuters reports claiming that a Twitter account connected to the Internet's most notorious cybercrime group was using Tor to post detailed instructions to steal money. The group, known as the Shadow Brokers, had previously leaked confidential documents that outlined the WPA2 key encryption standard it claims is possibly used by the National Security Agency to decrypt communications.\n <br> Security researchers Michal Kosinski of Palo Alto Networks and WIRED senior reporter Andy Greenberg immediately questioned how this was happening? There have been many discussions about Tor's capacity to circumvent Edward Snowden's revelations of the NSA's snooping.\n <br> Advertisement\n <br> Let's Cut to the Dashboard\n <br> There's a lot of concern over Tor's continued ability to bypass the security exploits reported by Covenant Eyes. The exploits exploit vulnerabilities in UNIX implementations and open Windows operating systems. UCSD researchers are working on both open and closed source exploits tailored for the world's two most compromised computer systems\u2014Windows and Mac OS X. Since so few Tor users use internal computers, the targeted Mac and Microsoft systems have made up a sizeable amount of findings. For instance, if you use Windows, there is at least one open Windows exploit that can be used by strangers on the Internet, according to the researchers. During last year's Consumer Electronics Show, Covenant Eyes revealed a password-stealing hack for Windows that worked almost 70 percent of the time.\n <br> Tor's vulnerabilities are possible because the technology is almost 19 years old and relies on talented volunteers to maintain the anonymity network. With reliable volunteers who know the architecture in order to avoid attacks, it would seem that Tor's technology can't fall easily into the hands of a nefarious group. There is no Chinese-style firewall in place. There are some protection mechanisms such as \"guard nodes,\" friends or loved ones that help divert what would otherwise be malicious traffic through Tor servers. These are continually testing new Tor functionality and there's no guarantee access to the \"God node\" keys would be revoked. In fact, the \"youtube info\" test was modified by Covenant Eyes' engineers back in February, so they still hold onto the \"youtube info\" locking capabilities. That said, they aren't saying TOR would confirm or deny those claims.\n <br> The good news for developers is Tor isn't off limits to 200 or so thousand researchers around the world working on the Tor Project, according to MIT Technology Review. The bad news? The vulnerability has been sitting exposed for nearly two months. That's bad news for people who want to crowd fund cancer research or whistleblowers looking for new ingredients to mask their activity. Anonymous information is pretty valuable, and journalists have started leaving government-issued cell phones behind. Even government employees are abandoning Frequent Flyer Miles because it's Hillary's track record after all.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter\n <br> When Dennis Webb saw Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"The Terminator\" in 1991, he thought: \"I bet that guy could play a 5-year-old boy.\"\n <br> The sad reality: In addition to the hewing Arnold's body into shape, the movie star also was cutting his height nearly in half to play a 10-year-old boy in the flick \u2014 and to keep the mishap-prone actor from realizing two dreams at the same time.\n <br> \"I'm a very physical man,\" Webb told TODAY before debuting pictures of himself with The Terminator himself on TODAY in July.\n <br> At 54 months, Dennis Webb barely fits the casting call for 'The Terminator' in 1991. \"Even though I look younger in the movie.\" Today\n <br> His tall frame has caused problems before, but 1986\u2032s \"Little Rascals\" was an exception.\n <br> \"My daughter Elizabeth wanted me to go see 'Little Rascals,'\" Webb said. \"I thought she was being completely serious.\" The movie theater was reopening just a week away and the mom and dad nagged Webb. But he went anyway.\n <br> \"At the end of the movie, they show a commercial \u2014 'the world's tallest mother'. My daughter reminded me, 'Look at the commercials for you mom's height.
