{"output": "FORT LAUDERDALE \u2014 A south Florida legislator is facing the departure of his GOP-led legislative caucus after calling President-elect Donald Trump an \"ignorant son of a bitch\" during a party-line vote last week.\n <br> State Reps. Jonathan Sachs of Davie sued the late afternoon Dec. 13 vote as a last-ditch effort to prevent Republicans from hexing the 45th President-in-Waiting in future votes, local media reported.\n <br> The barn-burning comments earnedAdvertisement\n <br> Sachs ramped up his rhetoric during a Dec. 9 meeting with then-House Speaker Will Weatherford. A spokesman for the retiring Weatherford denied the lawmaker had any such screed but confirmed he had \"passed on the fact that [Sachs] had used the gorilla in the room\" to describe Nixon.\n <br> he sparred with several Republicans in the fractious, year-old committee before he spoke his piece later that night, the Broward-Palm Beach New Times reported.\n <br> \"I've come under a lot of fire because I'm here, I'm paying attention and all the people talking have been talking about Mr. Trump, but you guys are talking about Anthony Weiner,\" Sachs said, referencing the disgraced New York Democrat who wined, dined and helped defile his victims.\n <br> \"We know nasty things about Donald Trump, we just don't talk about them,\" Sachs said, drawing a standing ovation from the nearly packed chamber. \"I think it's probably my duty to start talking.\"\n <br> Sachs on Thursday filed papers asking the Florida Supreme Court to dissolve the GOP caucus and mandate replacement candidates. He complained that his colleagues aggressively sought negatives on Trump such as the March 2014 proposal to pay Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people in Orlando's Pulse club.\n <br> \"It was a racist and incendiary smear that was never supposed to happen,\" Sachs said.\n <br> A spokesman for Republicans in the legislature did not respond to multiple calls seeking comment. Both parties broadly support Trump's agenda at the federal, state and county levels. At the state and local level, the GOP maintains significant power throughout Florida during each election, especially in places like Miami-Dade and Broward County of 20 electoral votes each.\n <br> While prominent Republicans supported Trump from the GOP establishment during the general election, those 10 Republicans in the Florida Legislature made Trump the center of their political universe, possibly contributing to his victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the Sunshine State.\n <br> \"Despite his immense mandate, the GOP wants to torpedo the president-elect, perhaps until there is a second scandal erupting from the swamp,\" Sachs said. \"Simply speaking to Mr. Trump doesn't reform public policy. Mr. Trump has the mandate and members of the Republican Party have the task, no matter their intentions, to carry out some popular fundamental reforms that they have long desired.\"\n <br> His complaints come after the Florida GOP criticized four other state lawmakers last month for failing to defend Trump: State Reps. Paul Henlinger, Donald Coneigle and Sean Shaw, all Republican, and State Sen. Jeff Clemens, a Democrat.\n <br> In six tweets last week, Henlinger said the sticking point in the long-running federal probes into Russia's interference in the U.S. elections has been \"Trump's personal financial transactions with Russia\" and he wants the conduct investigated.\n <br> Coneigle said that while he voted for Trump, he has concerns when it comes to potential ties to the Russian government.\n <br> \"An electors vote should include a disapproval of the customer,\" Coneigle tweeted. \"And that is Trump\"\n <br> __<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Married at First Sight has only been on Bravo for a couple months but it's already gained plenty of viewers and praise for the program's ongoing reality-making ethics. Last week nudistographer Alessandra Ambrosio and her husband Adam Zamoyski attempted to attend a college party free of charge. Her idea was to inspire a diversity of body types, and her strategy was simple: Be who she wanted to be. The couple entered into an unconventional wedding-planning partnership, sharing much of the rehearsal day and encouraged guest cameras to much care without ever undercutting their commitment.\n <br> It had all the makings of a teenage-dream clear out: amazing real-life fodder, colorful lights, gorgeous costumes, and endless boozy fun. It was also a nightmare for the couple \u2013 couple conflict \u2013 and kept their honeymoon fixed at the park. The pair see settling the conflict as their burden. It's why Ambrosio, a nose-candidate, perfectly latches on to John Hall \u2013 even when neither half knew what an acceptable t-shirt would be for a nudist wedding.\n <br> The first challenge was motion; NBC's school-run pool was shapeless water, and a grueling 60-minute third act event would be held entirely underwater.
