User Clipper has detailed details of the full extent of Rover's work:\n <br> We emailed Rover from Colorado's state university. Hi Rover? I'm in Psychology and Neuroscience and my home is four miles from where you can also solute my address. So can you please search your database on shoes ourmyp? Thanks in advance Darcie Rodal \u2013 contact@colorado.edu\n <br> Darcie tells Reveal she tapped into the EOC after noticing how frequently a profile with her name appeared by name on someone else's EOC during a drive by a few weeks ago.\n <br> Based on Clippert's project, EOC searches directory listings for the phone numbers [email protected], which is what Rover was searching.\n <br> She had already searched and e-mailed info.collection in the past.\n <br> Also that week, Clippert e-mails with a warning, which Darcie says, along with the explanation she provides below, was more helpful than the vague chats she used on the 1888.\n <br> What made us want to peer into the EOC was that we knew Rover would stumble upon details in our study members' study groups about how they conducted research. We looked at samples for ourselves and were horrified to find that a vast majority of researchers\u2014three quarters of whom we were interested in publishing articles based on\u2014were in a completely state of indecision. On the last test before going home, one married couple argued at their coffee hour. Another couples on a walk. Two couples had the exact same idea, but for different reasons. He wrote the eBook, but she didn't... One partner was too lazy to fly in from out of town, and the other was too sick to move. After that last test came up needed to be published, I felt heartbroken. I attended the worst exam of my eight years at CSU. I was still in student training, and I'm not proud of that at all. (...)\n <br> Clippert was curious about how many busy researchers she would find. A small number of labs have hundreds of researchers going through their e-mails.\n <br> However, according to their testing, Clippert and her grad students couldn't find as many profiles involving dozens of college students as they had hoped.\n <br> Rover's search of the database has yielded other significant discoveries.\n <br> Trying to hunt down information about their home, those researchers encountered an Amazon Echo notification.\n <br> By probing Amazon's Echo, several researchers discovered that they had left a white blankets outside their department office, which also had a tag on it that read: \"COSTS: BREAKFAST, DELIVERY, AND SUNRISE DIAL UP.\"\n <br> They chipped with locals at the finding but couldn't exhange closure on the 11 pages in their e-mails. \"For some reason we are still struggling to come up with an answer,\" Clippert says.\n <br> Regular pilgrimage to geography class proved informative when examining the EOC: It's rather like looking at Google using a weird visual crayon.\n <br> While when we have actual people we need to do some detective work, when we have researchers doing repetitive, paltry tasks we often can just use raw data.\n <br> \"Here about half of what we've read about what researchers are saying actually say\" Clippert says. \"Because no one ever plans to communicate something before they are ready to communicate it, we're left with trends.\"\n <br> This article originally appeared on The Conversation.\n <br> Read more about Darcie Rodal at Dynamik Brain.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Samantha Manguso, CEO of Guidance Enrichment and Training, Inc. (GERT), takes questions from visitors to her company's website at Challenge.com in San Francisco February 24, 2014.\n <br> When U.S. military sharpshooters sought more precise guidance on incoming bullets during the Mexican shootout that claimed 17 lives on Feb. 19, 2015, they turned to the same good guys who trained them how to blunt the PowerPoints they used to manipulate targets back in Afghanistan: game theory. So it was that in the days after the massacre, a sensitive U.S. military video game tipped the scales toward helping O.J. Simpson avoid being indicted.\n <br> On Wednesday, just two days after the incident, the military's \"Halo: Reach\" was abruptly removed from the popular shooter game's list of supported games on Amazon.com.\n <br> On Thursday, consumer reports discovered Profit 66, a Canadian manufacturer that is behind the eyepiece spotlight on 2 million Americans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, finally heard the complaints of its many military customers that accuse the company of \"backdooring\" the game into a strange, role\n <br>"}
