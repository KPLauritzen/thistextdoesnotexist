{"output": "Only a third of Russians have a favorable view of President Vladimir Putin. ((SPUTNIK/Agence France-Presse))\n <br> A majority of Russians do not have a favorable opinion of their president, and 62 per cent view him negatively, according to a recent nationwide poll.\n <br> The poll, conducted between Feb. 7-10, also revealed lack of trust in opinion-makers in the Kremlin. About 60 per cent of respondents criticise the politicians the president appoints.\n <br> The data comes a day before top-ranking diplomats from Russia, the U.S. and Europe will meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit in St. Petersburg, which is meeting amid heightened tensions between Moscow and the West over the crisis in Ukraine.\n <br> A total of 64 per cent of all Russians said they support the current leadership while 15 per cent said they oppose it. Older people were more likely to oppose the current leadership, with more than two thirds of over-65s (68 per cent) saying they support it against only 16 per cent who say they claim to oppose it.\n <br> increase in partisanship brand ERELEC found, the country's dissatisfaction is generally higher among the older generation, with six out of ten of those taking part saying their own household is \"totally\" or \"mostly\" in opposition to their government's policies.\n <br> However, 39 per cent of those aged under 25 show a positive point of view regarding the government's policies.

The government defended the decision, but declined to say how their decision came to light before it was announced.\n <br> Sociologica Rossii was asked broadly about media freedom, with 56 per cent of people saying they are \"extremely\" or \"very\" worried about such freedom. Indeed, 35 per cent felt casual lack of media freedom was the main reason why Russians wouldn't leave the country.\n <br> About a third of all Russians say they are worried about disease, nearly a quarter say respect for life is at a minimum level, about 18 per cent said they worry about the police, 15 per cent said they worry about fighting terrorism, and about 13 per cent mentioned people being victims of corruption.\n <br> More than one third of Russians believe the Kremlin treats the LGBT community \"disproportionately.\" (GABRILLA DUZO/AFP/Getty Images)\n <br> About 67 per cent of those surveyed said they were very or somewhat afraid of becoming criminals and 25 per cent said their fear was significant, meaning they would worry about it sufficiently to avoid committing crime.
