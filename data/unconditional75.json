{"output": "ARLINGTON, Ill. -- Chicago Blackhawks winger Marian Hossa made an impressive first impression on rookie forward Nikita Zaitsev.\n <br> The left-wing rookie scored the lone goal of the second period to lift the Washington Capitals on a 4-3 win in the second round of the playoffs Thursday night. Zaitsev had an assist in the win at the United Center.\n <br> \"I think he made a pretty good first impression on me,'' Zaitsev said. \"I think he sort of just took the game by the horns, pretty absorb all I got. He came up big and really I thought took advantage of a couple of chances.''\n <br> Hossa, who had hat tricks in the first three games of the conference semifinals against the Florida Panthers, wasted little time getting to ice. He took a pass from Sharp and sent Kyle Beacham backhand-in-front that was parried by goalie Andrei Vasilevskiy. The score was 1-0 before the second period began. About 20 seconds later, Hossa also tally, beating a screened Vasilevskiy.\n <br> Hossa came up with the big play earlier than Keith Tkachuk (vs. Tampa Bay), who found a streaking Brendan Smith in Anaheim. Both Hossa and Smith now have four assists this postseason. Smith has played 17:46, yet has four goals and two assists total.\n <br> \"[Hossa] found a lot of space in the slot [Thursday],\" Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said. \"You see that in most of the games, but he made a good play making him (Hossa) come up with his goalie stuck out of the net. His quickness and the body. He's got a fantastic shot and he's got great hands. \u2026 We have a few guys who can set him up and execute and set things up pretty well. He makes some great plays and he loves the game, so you know he has to be a good player.''\n <br> The officials helped set the tone early. Anders Lee drew a penalty while battling Hossa for an early edge on the ice. After Hossa set up Hossa by moving the puck across the crease, Olli Maatta went to school on the goalkeeper.\n <br> Zaitsev and Ryan Callahan were called for hooking during the first period. Threatening a working penalty kick, Chicago defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk fed the puck up high between two defenders in the Washington zone, then steered it to Callahan in the slot.\n <br> Callahan's shot was stopped by Smith, then was redirected by Joel Ward on the glove side.\n <br> Zaitsev roped one in from the slot with 26 seconds remaining in the second period, and Detroit Red Wings coach Mike Babcock called it a typical scoring chance away from the puck.\n <br> Enter Ryan Getzlaf. He took a cross-ice feed from Patrick Eaves and moved up the ice so he could wrangle onto the forecheck from behind. Getzlaf wrayed a backhanded play past Joe Corvo.\n <br> On the next shift, Arizona Coyotes defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson threw to his forehand, and Getzlaf snapped a backhand backhand past Smith on his body.\n <br> Getzlaf got to one with practically zero time left -- just 1:35 remaining -- as Smith used a rebound to spoil the USC goalie and Portland Winterhawks goalie Matt Murray's shutout attempt. Getzlaf beat the left side of his nettee for an empty-net goal.\n <br> \"It was a good chance,'' Getzlaf said. \"The advantage [Murray] had was kind of difficult to get away from by the way he played. I think I got there between the skates, so have to tip my hat to him having that much time left and then he made a really good save on me.\n <br> \"I think I was just waiting for the rebound and saw a little push and I kind of moved my legs a little bit to shoot this puck. I kind of just hit it and put [goalie Mike Smith] on his butt. When you miss a deal like that next one, you go back and I savor it from there.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>A chief executive from Austin-based telecom operator Time Warner Cable will now be considered impeachment by the US House of Representatives after a scathing report was released detailing the conduct of its employees that no longer can be met with the \"Kumbaya\" shoulder to shoulder embrace.\n <br> Housemember Darius Loskarn apologized for airing his warning to fellow Austin city officials about the acts of its employees before going on to file articles of impeachment against the head of Time Warner Cable in Texas, David L.
