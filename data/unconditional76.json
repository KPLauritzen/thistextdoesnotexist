{"output": "Nobody should be surprised, to justify the platform: the Hillary Clinton machine long ago decided to become an amoral media and party machine, the Trump Machine is the media and the party machine \u2014 and now the media and the Party Machine want to head for the greener pastures of an open bigot herifiable just plain despicable enough to be omniscient appealing. Like --4 billion lives to save. Not everybody wants the presidential show. You just can't make this stuff up. And a visitor in the Swamp had confided to me when before the campaign that they had been taking notes on the vile and distasteful thuggery put on display step by step on the trail virtually every day twenty years ago when she ran for the U.S. Senate, but it had now become such regular front page fare no one wanted to do anything about it. One Republican said out loud, \"The way they are attacking Trump seems more and more like a campaign of fear from what I've been reading and listening to.\" After the third debate, the coming together of two resentful factions of the unusual Joe world -- racists and leftists are the two main targets -- ought to be of unremarkable interest, especially when the Clintonite slime probe goes nuclear. But unless you are Bill and Hillary, you won't notice it.\n <br> ----------\n <br> If Voter Suppression isn't the Order of the Day, then why is It, Why is Hillary Clinton's murderer and Hillary's co-conspirator Bill Clinton and the stench of that operation stench everywhere in this news cycle? Because the same way Donald Trump is solidly on one side or the other \u2014 I am sure the 'My base's too small to win 65 million people in a year' Hillary supporters are on one side or the other \u2014 the right wing at the usual firms are doing its usual distraught lamentation of, \"We hacked this one!\" particularly when it doesn't fit their anti Trump culture and stuff. What we see is the traditional conservative information ecosystem, informally known the \"apologist industry,\" flailing wildly in search of a better way to stop Trump. And yet polls show that Trump would easily beat Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head matchup. All of the usual assumptions about the Republican base are wrong: Younger Whites found Trump pleasing but not as repulsed by Hillary by whites over age 46. The overall message that is striking is remarkably similar to the one that started the Evangelical Netflix hackathon over Mike Pence, the common assumption being how would the Evangelical base show up; so far we don't see redemption in your view for the douche bag to be Gov. Mike Pence. Millennials love to talk to millennials, and Millennial voters are more broadly supportive of free speech. Perhaps you will not have the same success on that one. And third is the weak media; no one has other than a few CEOs of national media organizations claiming the GOP as their enemy, Larry King is Plagiarism Apologist but the Trump crowd is their Enemy! Incidentally, we're just gonna add that Bernie Sanders, a pretty insane man but nonetheless acceptable to the media and at least in the estimation of its viewership at least, shows that the left warrior documented Roll Call sniping at Fox News is a bit extreme. And we're not going to defend Donald Trump the indigent thief, either.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Judgment and Error in the Philippines\n <br> By Philip M. Boyle\n <br> Philip M.
