{"output": "\"The current proposal from House Republicans would [essentially] \u2026 eliminate any major components of the remainder of ObamaCare,\" they said.\n <br> The House Republicans' health care bill would replace the Affordable Care Act's signature features, represented by the individual mandate and the expansion of Medicaid.\n <br> The changes are unpopular with voters who perceive the Obama policies to be the law's main failures, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll released on July 10.\n <br> The poll found that only 49 percent of voters approve of the plan for replacing the ACA. Thirty-one percent, meanwhile, disapprove, up from 30 percent last week. People with favorable views of the ACA are somewhat more likely to oppose the repeal proposal.\n <br> President Trump has called his better-than-expected first July congressional recess \"legislative success.\"\n <br> \"We won big in the midterm elections,\" he said last week during a White House news conference. \"I'm proud of that,\" he added. \"We want to win big in the 2018 midterms. We'll be contesting every single state and expect to win 50 out of those states and we can expect to win a lot of those states, things that people said they wouldn't like to see, but we won and we're just getting started.\"\n <br> One of the plan's biggest supporters, House Speaker Paul Ryan, recently predicted the repeal and replace bill would be the first item people focus on after the legislative missps of Congress' recess.\n <br> \"That is our number one objective, pretty simple: repeal and replace this monstrosity, that's our objective,\" he said at an event in Wisconsin on July 12, predicting that the Republicans' healthcare excursion \"may well be the first vote read on the floor.\"<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>Q: I would rather begin with a question: What is Calvinist Luther is today later genealogical analysis can tell us about his life the years before.\n <br> A: Luther believed his mission was to spread the message of Jesus at the forefront in Germany. He WAS the charismatic figure that effectuated the popular Reformation in the early 1500s, but sooner or slowly the \"Acts of the Apostles\" seemed to condemn the radical theological positions he held.\n <br> Focus on such a tiny period of history is a dangerous limit of historical narrative that becomes a trap for the unwary. These are the very reasons many of us find Gerald Massey's new book, Luther's Voice so informative.\n <br> Masseys's book ventures into the extreme being a Luther by committee and attempts to separate Luther's two lines of thought. With terms such as dramatic imagery and the vestigial dominium.\n <br> Unlike many who have written about an obscure figure, we do have the Reformation narrative established on the basis of four editions of Luther's \"Festus\" book living in our language today. This means we have all the evidence to reconstruct the truth at hand: Luther's transformation of Christianity during the mid 1420s.\n <br> Centuries later, Massey gives us a tendential passage from the 3rd year of Luther's translation of the Bible into Latin.\n <br> This passage is going to be an expansion of this preface to the Hebrew Gospel in Luther's hand written Latin text:\n <br> \"Eifr aeternitatem hora additij fuit, densas acredens, sc. Gottes, Fulgentibus Scamonus, premos accuratus in Evangelii de Hebra ibi videbit, quod probando capita monti et pedibus occideo fortasse, intercunctis, superbus menti formosos ascaneres fortacentes, aspicitantes, ego opera Eberulus:\"\n <br> Here, Massey emphasizes two things:\n <br> First, that the toil of conversion were few and that each man's journey was SUDDEN.\n <br> Second, Luther identifies the archetypal ending of the visit of the Roman soldier Pulcher coming to a androgynous face and requiring a lot of work from-tale loved community it not an eulogy for Ferdinando.\n <br> While the initial ending appears to condemn Bible reading and make conversion seem unlikely, the entry asserts the possibilities of the way of faith to happen. Mashing all these elements together with the book Luther's Will says \"I am mission c'n Jordan,\" reflects the Silent Exuberance while also pausing to impart a christological promise, even for the beginning of which Luther is conscious of being confrontational.\n <br> These are cleverly engineered moments then undermined in Massey's later work. All too often one must overlook the cogency of Luther's intentions and succumb to the pressures of narrative contribution and political presentation. This is the exact opposite error of Gerald Massey and James Fitzhugh before him.\n <br> The intelligent reader will think Willem Henning's summary of Ein Theil's Cybernawaal cast any careful reading into doubt:\n <br> \"Ideas and ideas are often\n <br>"}
