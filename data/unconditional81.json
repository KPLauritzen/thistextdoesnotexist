There are, of course, unified players \u2013 like Stevie Ray Vaughan, who were groomed in the Buckethead milieu as children, or Don Henley and Merle Haggard, who learned from Bucket at kitchens and hard rock dives. But there's Jean Grae and Jeff Hanneman's rosters of really exciting newcomers \u2013 Lamar Leonard, Junior Sanchez, Dan Shulman, Steve Shultz, Ikaika Anderson and 4 extra members. On tour, heading out on a bucket of sub-zero, shrill, retro rock has never been more inspired.\n <br> <br> Buckethead Flies to the Sun\n <br> <br> CONSINGER, CA (April 26, 2013)-- A documentary film crew made three brief stops at two Buckethead shows at the 9:30 Club in Huntington Beach Saturday, bringing out the footage for filming for \"B Buckethead Flies to the Sun\" by Tony Colanza, filmmaker and co-founder of Hide Films .\n <br> Filming finished following Saturday's show at the CHEVY RIVIERA with several bumps on the road, but, at least the crew sounds effervescent producing some of the most Gaslight Glass food truck shocks we've ever seen at the venue. Producer Bruce Coleman is again helping in the release with a new enhanced version and VHS video of Saturday's show taking place this weekend.\n <br> Buckethead: Touched by the Sun\n <br> Check out the trailer for \"B Buckethead Flies to the Sun\" available at Facebook or YouTube\n <br> <br> Bill Callahan, producer of several of Buckethead's recent live DVD releases with Oklahoma native himself, is proud to work in some of Parker Lewis' crazier material for Buckhead Carnival. Callahan tapped Austin Jones of Dallas rock band Even More Boring which released last year an album with Buckethead. Jones explains, \"Taken straight from my days playing with Buckethead, we thought we'd do stuff a little different for the opening night of Buckethead Flies to the Sun. Just trying something new that people had never heard in the set before. Just got random 5-6 minute songs piled top to bottom on the sampler as it airs at the pool party, or my hotel room surveillance burre! I can't wait to hear how she returns it.\"\n <br> <br> Concert footage will be sent they way of Austin Jones, and Callahan would imagine an official DVD or audio would do the trick if anyone is interested. However, even if you're a fan of Crypta Music, you'll probably want to hold on to the demo tape from Poor Cabin. Callahan gets, \"This is fucking weird alright\" when it comes to it's hard rock, dropping the n-word for about 15 minutes\n <br>"}
