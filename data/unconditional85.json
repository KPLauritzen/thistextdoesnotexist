Last week's Coca-Cola exec Treasury's call for the lifting of all sanctions on the occupation of Syria - products including products such as Coca-Cola, Nestle/ASDA and PepsiCo's Fanta and Crush juices fly straight to the chopping block- actually only shows that the global food lobby at large is still intensely concerned about its corporate bottom line, and that those in the US who object to its moral concerns are extremely strident.\n <br> Notwithstanding research\n <br>"}
