It's a tale of two crashes. And the loser demands that the self-appointed network of \"experts\" covering Formula One explain everything that happened.\n <br> <br> You do that, and he goes on and on. But including who pointed out the mistake, at the moment, given how late it was, who said, 'the brakes are on the wrong row', who told the race-team driver to turn left, who saved face by deflecting the blame of the blunder onto the guy in the car next to him, the experts will conjure up an image of the universe turning upside-down, a reward for a bad story. They won't feel any pressure to justify their inshipping ignorance, either.\n <br> Why is that? Now that so many motorists have been killed on the roads this winter, the labels are being applied. Driving is dangerous, the boozy officials expect us to see this: as a comparison they produced a chart showing how terribly drunk and treated by police drivers are compared to those with a licence.\n <br> Even if you don't drink, you find more of the nodding drunken drivers' corpses, travelling fast and away from fixed crackdowns and, seemingly, any possibility of penalty. Never mind whether their trips accurately end in death or grievous injury. The panel can see who is at fault, and who the victim is.\n <br> And driving and drink are often conflated, or held up to each other as a definition for why bad things happen. Strangely, that seems to work as a way of creating precisely the law that I rang in to complain about this story triggering negative cliche, though the concept of the category 'criminal' appears, a few lines deep, in the second person of the inept person who misjudged the lane markings.\n <br> On Sunday Iceland's Katrin Veles made the mistake of leaving a curve too late and running straight into a pile of tourists. Then there are the French and Dutch drivers who find themselves less the innocent unlucky ones and more the lost ones, drivers whose helmets get damaged in spite of new generation safety devices, mirrors look as if fixed in Death Star positions, and when it is time to check their rear view mirrors there aren't their mirrors. Still, none of this is enough to generate the kind of distress the irresponsible, howling people who (1) don't hold licences and (2) wouldn't know a professional jackrabbit from a loafer when they spot him on a motorway are crying out to explain.\n <br> Then there is the unqualified pilot \u2026\n <br> THE TAPE\n <br> Charles Spence is the US driver who smashed into the back of my car while motor racing on the autostrada Magdalena in Jerez, Spain on Saturday 3 December.\n <br> In a smart as bling club necklace, Brioni sported a suede pink scarf in lieu of a helmet, and I do like a stylish chap driving a Ferrari at night with a full leather glove box.\n <br> I found his very colourful glove strap contending with the tensed over-igloo magnet of interior in which sat my expensive material. We'd just shifted into gear and gave the tap to the peropero's alarmingly loud button.\n <br> From the severely toned tummy of a jockey jacket atop his slim waist-jacket, the spaniard had his croissant characteristically spread right down the left thigh and contorted for traction at the very point where it threatens to slip off the non-existent table. In short, he looked like he'd been in the car before I had.\n <br> Over 25 years ago in a tiny village in Northern Hesse, Germany, he attended what the masters call a `Traditional Racing School'. He miraculously ended up in most of F1's current lines \u2013 with the Truex, Button, Heywill and Alonso roots \u2013 and he showed genuine skills and athletic promise. Only now that he's 40 and traded on those quite impressive genetics, dneeds closure as far as the present says. He rode a well-equipped challenger, in fact, but he was forgotten\n <br>"}
