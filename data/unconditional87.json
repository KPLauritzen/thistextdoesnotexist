{"output": "The Knights of Columbus declared March 11, 2016, as David-O-Ching Day, a day to honor the historical nationalist leader. The decision followed a decision by the national and local chapter to withdraw its support from the Mexican American Studies Program after the program's honorary chapter at the Georgetown University campus posted videos Sept. 2 that appear to glorify the execution of a Mexican family by the Mexican army, suggesting South American nationalists seek war against Mexico. \"The opening ad -- right before the screening of the movie 'The Rules of Warriors: A History of Honor' -- has been interpreted by several bloggers and social media outlets as a precursor to any types of violence or hate speech against Mexicans and Latinos by those who took fright at seeing the ad,\" reads a statement issued by the national Knights of Columbus. However, an ad placed by a group that identifies with the program does not appear to include any violence and is not using the above passages, but instead presents some historical background about David-O-Ching, including his apparent work with Rio Tinto, founder of several transnational mining corporations, and then goes further. \"It is now almost ten years since the Mexican Society made it known that they could no longer continue to associate with the David-O-Ching Foundation,\" the ad reads. \"The ads that many people mistakenly perceive as advocacy of violence are repeatedly fine-tuned and edited. We never endorse or condone violence of any kind. There are lots of things that upset Mexicans and invite push back -- but the tone and words people attach to the ads is far from what we intended.\" Founded by his third wife, Thuy Bon Hoang, in 1951, David-O-Ching is associated with Vietnam-era leaders Da Hieu Tap and Hieu Ann, a United States Corps of Engineers project under his \"Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross\" to provide medical aid to political prisoners in Vietnam. He later headed the \"Anglo-Vietnamese Red Cross\" for nearly two decades, advising efforts to develop food enterprises in Vietnam that included blundering operations that saw him officiate ceremonies at which 13 children were forced to slaughter pigs. But at that point in his life and career, David-O-Ching did not advocate for war and was advised by the Chin Hoa Kieu to stay away from that conflict. He could not have known back then that the lukewarm Cold War track record that benefited his businesses in Vietnam would mean a lifetime of posting hard-edged ads about conflict for foreign audiences as a prominent member of the Trilateral Commission. This is the next step in the arc of the slippery slope that began with the giveaway of Chi Ceng's grave to barefoot excavators in 1995 and has made its way to Deep South Elites shouting their outrage at those 'century soldiers eating blackbirds' after the skeletal remains were gradually retrieved from a quarry two years later. \"Day one is David-O-Ching Day,\" reads the banner to a recent concert headlined by Grandmaster Flash.<br><br><|endoftext|><br><br>News\n <br> A murder investigation is underfoot after an attempt on Vitalii Solo's life.\n <br> Jan 19, 2016\n <br> A murder investigation is underfoot after an attempted murder of former Real Madrid star Vitali.
