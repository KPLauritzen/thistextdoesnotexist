Not seeing the stars, is the first honest thing we look at.\n <br> By refusing to view within the context of where they play or how the needs at the top are debated, the clubs and managers appreciate that it is not cost or competition that decides who wins games but most importantly who spends what resources to do so, the fans know what they would get out of a price tag and can judge which clubs are worth their money, they know which managers are worth following, play to wins not travels and are motivated to win trophies because they care more than anything else why their club is on people's minds. Admitting either what happens lessens any meaning that a new player may provide or because they won't have a future in the Premier League.\n <br> For the fans, you either care what happens to the good team or not at all. The bottom line is that each club does what the fans want, like Arsenal buying Olivier Giroud last year, either to fund large players or invest in both to ensure they are not one of the worst teams in league, this ensures that any strike or injuries to key players increases the chance that manager or boss will remain or is sacked.\n <br> As for the national side, most continue and are joined by Britain who might not be all that prepared to sacrifice what they hold dear on the pitch for a logo or new star. That's why there's been no sign of the likes of Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez even when they are everyone's favourite, much like Di Maria and Bale has been accepted and that also concerns the England squad as players both in and out, particularly now in the age of shirking collective responsibility, and this is one of the greatest flaws of the footballing model.\n <br> I also think Benitez's views on buying more players at a dip in form would measure as one of his worst decision in a manager's managerial career. That there are no world class all-round midfielders to lead the line and rotate centre halves are of real importance to the better teams as it explains the ups and downs to what ends up happening, because not only is speed of the game the most essential aspect and not what makes the game come alive, it's also important to breaks up defensive lines and break down the opposition game.\n <br> THIS MAKES THE BIG CIZZOS, AS THEY HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST 20 YEARS, GET AWAY WITH SO MANY DERIVATIVES THAT THEY REQUIRE AN INITIATIVE TO FIX \u2013 VIVA LA LIGA LENIGO.\n <br> There's no one yet in place that inspires excitement, Citesa's Ruben Quiroz aka @ELSmithMercato is known mostly for a small part in being the lyricist for the songs sung in the paint pan.
