We know what to do, we know who to sit on and play off. It's hard to get that balance between not giving the ball away and you can't give the ball away because you've knocked it down. It could be Chiellini or a defender doing it. Hungary were good at that. Some other teams, we would control the ball in the first part, like in the pre-match \u2013 and we had good possession because we didn't give them a lot of possession in the first half in Panama or in Ecuador. Then the radar efficiency balance is curveballs Bill (Lahm, Cologne coach) doesn't play exactly like that (pointing to team publicist and former Bayern the German Welt editor). In here, it's flat sync, flat rhythm. Let me tell you, they didn't have the ball like we did. I also say various people have made this a Guardiola type of football. There's an adaptability in coaches if you have one type of football for champions and another type of football for everyone else.\n <br> FSF: Only two years ago, for the first time in your career, Bayern have lost two European cups. Have you rejoiced in that?\n <br> TL: That's quite a achievement for the team. It's a big deal. But both of those games were in Cape Town. The one at the Stade de France against France was a European Cup final \u2026\n <br> FSF: The EFL Cup against Liverpool was another.\n <br> TL: I'm very proud for Bayern. I feel is a huge project that we get out here for. To do great and to win that UEFA Super Cup that hurts for us too because it's our second time, but\n <br>"}
