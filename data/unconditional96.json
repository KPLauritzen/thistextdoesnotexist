{"output": "Mazda Constellation news updates\n <br> June 13, 2016 - 12:43 PM\n <br> by Brett Jewkes\n <br> <br> Mazda Constellation news updates\n <br> Mazda Tuesday set production alert orders Wednesday with plans to make 75 cars a day if the new U.S. federal tax incentives go through next year.\n <br> <br> The company halted production amid a worldwide glut of cars on the way to customers, and Mazda is looking at possible layoffs because of the loss of sales volumes.\n <br> <br> It is anyway unlikely to see such a significant lowering in standards because Tuesday's production action was only a partial slowdown of Tuesday's 600-baseline-car schedule through the third week of June. The current of production, if all went as planned, would be slightly more than the usual 50,000 a day.\n <br> <br> Vehicles are still assembled in the United States and vehicles able to be shipped to the U.S. will reach local consumers by the end of July, according to an industry source.\n <br> <br> Leonardo himself instigated the production alerts described last week by one industry official. He has been frequently at the Wall Street Journal headquarters advising on both corporation statements and online publication issues, said Harrison Graymore, executive editor of Automotive News.\n <br> <br> The U.S.-based automaker is currently concentrating on people troubles. About 5,000 out of the nation's 47,000 full-time employees are unemployed, and nearly 20,000 walk the picket line, said Mazda spokesman Michael Perry. The number of temporary workers is about the same.\n <br> <br> Mazda \"is here to stay and will continue to be,\" said Perry.\n <br> <br> Mazda President Muraleedharan said the automaker, the world's third-largest after Japan's automakers, made 1.2 million vehicles in 2015.\n <br> <br> Rebalancing\n <br> <br> While Ferrari set aside 300 million euros ($325.80 million) specifically for its U.S. development, Mazda is focusing more on revitalizing U.S. operations from its overseas operations.\n <br> <br> The company is planning an investment of about 1 billion euros in 2017 to improve operational performance by broadening the footprint of its operations in position to strengthen its footing in an already tough global market for refinement of trim levels of automobiles.\n <br> <br> About 100 people worked at the American facilities in 2015, with no plans for staff increases to be announced this year, said the source.\n <br> <br> Mazda's decision also was not made easily.\n <br> <br> Sometimes manufacturers have to set aside money for employee retraining when costs rise or production schedules are altered in China or other industrial countries. The company is determined to eliminate redundancies and staff further.\n <br> <br> Production already was down about 500,000 vehicles per year in North America, according to the source \u2014 substantially less than before the global financial crisis, when the European component parts abroad made up just 55 percent of U.S. sales.\n <br> <br> In the 18 to 24 month period following global financial crisis, the global component house shipments rose 8 percent to 24.2 million cars, according to the source.\n <br> <br> To determine the destination of incoming orders, job expansion needs to take place in order to meet first-quarter production goals for the new model year sedan. The smallest Mazda models aren't before dealerships until this fall, and mazda vehicles clearly are missing from the one-day sales bar at the Detroit auto show.\n <br> <br> From Australia to Mexico, slowing demand as the economy chews through the 100-percent local dollar ration has people more interested in used vehicles that aren't full-sized. Mazda makes vehicles in both the United States and China.\n <br> <br> Shipments from the U.S. to Hong Kong are down 94 percent from the average sales in 2009, according to the supplier customization manager.\n <br> <br> The widely required new fourth-generation vehicle, available in three different trim lines in Europe and more than 10 countries in Asia and 2.8-liter station-wagon will delay baseload delivery until October, according to the Wall Street source. The 2016 body style has longer wheelbase than last year's model.\n <br> <br> By the end of the month plans are to move 150,000 units to get on to than full hundreds of thousands of cars in which currency shifts look all uncertain.\n <br> <br> Last years four-cylinder IS500 spent some time in Hong Kong and Krome - a supplier of lag fixing parts - as postal service problems in responding to upcoming fall China lunar new year felled offerings before reaching Nazare Mad said analyst Brian Colello of Just Market.\n <br> <br> In response to the U.S. and European spot price increase, Nordax said it expects that second pricing of various vehicles to vary by the time they reach dealership sales. Diesel was added as a line of variations in North America back to the 2008 model year.\n <br> <br> All are available from dealers through special order. Initially, Chinese buyers will take on the lead from the Germans, who are rafting Valkyrie and Cobalt to such delivery.\n <br> <br> <br> <br>"}
